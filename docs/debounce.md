# Debounce (inbound message coalescing)

WhatsApp customers send several quick balloons ("oi", "tudo bem?", "queria saber…"). Answering each one is the #1 amateur tell and duplicates replies. Debounce waits for the customer to stop, then answers the **whole burst in one turn**. This is feature parity with the n8n workflows (which used a durable Postgres queue + a fixed Wait + supersede), reimplemented on our durable scheduler with the guards n8n lacked. It is **on by default** per agent.

This file documents the **Chatwoot** flush (`flushDebounceJob`, re-fetches the conversation from the live API). The independent **Z-PRO** channel shares the SAME `SchedulerJob` kind, fast worker, and `armDebounce` arming function (zero Chatwoot coupling) — `debounceFlushHandler` (`handler.ts`, below) branches to a Z-PRO-specific flush (`src/modules/zpro/debounce.ts`'s `flushZproDebounceJob`) that coalesces directly from the locally-mirrored `ZproMessage` table instead of re-fetching (Z-PRO has no anti-PII no-body-mirror constraint). See [`docs/zpro.md`](zpro.md#debounce-inbound-message-coalescing) for the full Z-PRO flow.

## Flow

```
incoming message (gate=act)                 fast worker tick (~2.5s)
        │                                            │
   webhook (processChatwootDelivery)          claimDueDebounceJobs (FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED)
        │  resolveDebounceConfig → enabled?          │
        ├─ yes → armDebounce (re-arm runAt)    flushDebounceJob
        └─ no  → runAgentTurn (direct, as before)    │ re-fetch messages → coalesce past watermark
                                                      │ run one turn (coalesced text)
                                                      │ shouldPost: re-fetch → superseded? → CAS reply claim
                                                      └ post once via the bot token
```

- **Arming** (`armDebounce`, `src/modules/debounce/service.ts`): one live `SchedulerJob` (`kind = DEBOUNCE`, `dedupeKey = debounce:<threadId>`) per thread. Each new message bumps `runAt = min(now + windowSeconds, burstStartedAt + maxWindowSeconds)` via upsert — the durable, crash-safe equivalent of n8n's supersede, with an anti-starvation cap n8n didn't have. Serialized per thread by an advisory lock so concurrent deliveries can't lose the burst-start stamp. The payload is JSON-safe (no bigint): `instanceId`/`conversationId` are recovered from `threadId`.
- **Dedicated fast worker** (`src/modules/debounce/worker.ts`, `DEBOUNCE_WORKER_INTERVAL_MS`, default 2500ms): drains **only** `DEBOUNCE` (`claimDueDebounceJobs`). The main scheduler tick (15s) claims the kinds the lane table assigns to it (`claimDueJobs` → `laneFilter("shared")`, derived from `JOB_LANE` in `src/modules/scheduler/lanes.ts`), so the window is honored without ticking the reaper/sweep that fast. That file also carries the rule for when a lane is warranted at all: **cadence or budget, never duration**. Debounce is the cadence case (this one); attendance compaction is the budget case. A kind that is merely slow needs no lane, because the shared tick drains its batch concurrently (issue #165). The scheduler's reaper still re-pends a stranded `CLAIMED` debounce job.
- **Flush** (`flushDebounceJob`, `src/modules/debounce/handler.ts`): re-fetch the thread (admin token), coalesce the incoming messages past `Conversation.lastHandledMessageId` (the **watermark**), cap at `maxMessagesPerBurst` (keep the most recent), feed the joined text to `runLoadedTurn`.
- **`coalesceAndRunTurn`** (same file, exported) is the reusable "re-fetch → select a burst → coalesce → answer once" core. It takes a `selectPending` strategy: the flush passes `pendingIncoming(_, watermark)`; the **manual re-engage** (item 6, `src/modules/conversations/reengage.ts`) passes "incoming after the last outgoing" to re-answer the unanswered tail without a new inbound. Both share the same supersede + reply-claim at-most-once guards below; a failed turn stamps `Conversation.lastError` (cleared on a successful post) so the operator sees an error badge + a re-engage button.

## Watermark + supersede (why no duplicate / no incomplete reply)

The re-fetch decision (not a durable buffer) keeps us aligned with the anti-PII rule (we never mirror message bodies). Correctness rests on two guards in `shouldPost`, evaluated AFTER the LLM call and BEFORE the post:

1. **Post-response supersede** (n8n-faithful): re-fetch and if any incoming id `> targetWatermark`, a message arrived mid-turn → **drop this reply** (outcome `superseded`); the re-armed job answers the full burst. Re-fetch failure is non-fatal (reply rather than drop; the re-armed flush covers any miss). This gate also runs for EMPTY replies (since the deferred-resolve change): an empty turn with a newer mid-turn message returns `superseded` (watermark untouched, re-armed flush answers the whole burst) instead of `empty`, and any deferred resolve intent is discarded with it.
2. **Monotonic reply claim, under the row's own lock**: `runLoadedTurn` takes it, in `Conversation.lastRepliedMessageId`, and it answers TWO questions in one transaction — "is anybody else answering this right now" (the claim itself, monotonic) and "has the handled watermark moved past what this caller may answer over" (`maxHandledAllowed`, read off the mark under the same lock). The loser suppresses, so a burst is answered **at most once** through ONE column for every posting path (the direct turn, the flush, its retry and the manual re-engage), which is what makes them contend instead of each sending (issue #452). It cannot be the watermark: that one is advanced by deliberate SKIPS as well as by answers, so after a human-owned stretch it stands ahead of the tail the re-engage answers, and a CAS there loses forever while reporting a race that never happened. The ceiling is what separates the callers rather than a flag: the direct turn and the flush answer ABOVE the mark and pass `target - 1`; the re-engage answers a tail the mark already covers and passes the mark it read on the way IN, so a skip landing while its model runs still refuses it — and a null reading is that ceiling too ("no mark was there"), never the absence of one, so any mark that appears under a running model refuses the claim. **The claim is taken before the send and never given back** — the same trade the watermark's CAS made before: a send that fails leaves the burst marked and nothing re-answers it, because a reply the customer already has cannot be taken back. The watermark advance happens after the turn, on every consumed outcome, and the flush's burst selection floors on the max of the two so a lost watermark write cannot cost a second reply.

   Alongside the advance, a consumed burst also **retires the ledger rows** of the messages it contained (`retireCoveredDeliveries`, issue #228), keyed by account + conversation + message and restricted to rows already `PROCESSING` (or `DEAD`, which it corrects). The gate exits, which decide before any fetch, state the burst as the range their watermark advance covers — bounded at BOTH ends, since open at the bottom it reaches back over a strand an earlier message left behind and closes a real loss for good. A burst re-read from Chatwoot can carry a message whose own webhook delivery died mid-processing, and that is the one case where re-reading the thread rescues something the ledger still shows as unfinished. The watermark cannot record it — it is a per-conversation high-water mark and this is a per-message fact — so the turn writes it where it belongs. The messages `maxMessagesPerBurst` takes OUT of the burst are retired too, always as `consumed`: the watermark advances past the whole burst either way, so leaving them open would report as lost a message the product looked at and deliberately dropped. `PENDING` is left alone because a burst also legitimately contains messages whose deliveries have not started yet, and consuming those would skip their mirror writes. A gate exit taken because **another AgentBot** now owns the conversation retires nothing at all: Chatwoot fans a message to up to two routes (`agent_bots_for`), so the owner's own delivery for a message in that range may be `PROCESSING` right now, and a range write would turn it `PROCESSED` — the one state the sweep never revisits. A **human** taking over is the opposite (they answer the message whichever route carried it) and so is a refusal by the contact-authorization gate (the conversation is still ours), and both keep the wide range. Best-effort: a miss costs a line in the stranded-delivery list, never a reply.

`runLoadedTurn` (`src/graph/runtime.ts`) is the shared tail of both the direct path and the flush: build → invoke → re-check the live assignee (human takeover aborts) → `shouldPost` → post.

## Configuration

Per-agent, in `agent.settings.debounce` (free-form bag, validated/clamped by `readDebounceConfig` in `src/modules/debounce/settings.ts` — a bad value can never break the flush). Surfaced in the agent editor's **Behavior** tab and writable over REST (`PATCH /v1/agents/:id`) and MCP (`agent_settings_get`/`agent_settings_set`, the `debounce` block), per "one core, three transports".

| Setting               | Default | Range    | Meaning                                                      |
| --------------------- | ------- | -------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| `enabled`             | `true`  | bool     | Off → the direct (balloon-by-balloon) path, unchanged.      |
| `windowSeconds`       | `15`    | 3–120    | Idle time after the last message before flushing.           |
| `maxMessagesPerBurst` | `20`    | 1–50     | Context/cost cap; the most recent N are kept.               |
| `maxWindowSeconds`    | `60`    | ≥ window | Anti-starvation: reply at most this long after burst start. |

Operational (env, NOT per-agent): `DEBOUNCE_WORKER_ENABLED`, `DEBOUNCE_WORKER_INTERVAL_MS` (keep it below the smallest window, 3s).

## Known limits (single-replica MVP)

- A transient LLM/Chatwoot error after a partial graph invoke can re-append the coalesced `HumanMessage` to the checkpointer on retry (a duplicated user line in context). Low-harm; rare.
- The supersede micro-race (a message arriving between the `shouldPost` re-fetch and the post) is irreducible without a transaction spanning the network. The window is one DB CAS + one POST.
- Concurrent flushes of one thread only become possible after the 5-min reaper window (an LLM call longer than the stale threshold); the watermark CAS still bounds it to one post.

Read before touching `src/modules/debounce/*`, the scheduler claim split, or the webhook → runtime seam.
