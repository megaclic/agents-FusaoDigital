// The audit trail viewer (TENANT_ADMIN). Rows newest first, filters in the URL, keyset pagination
// over a cursor stack — the same shape the Logs page uses, because it is the same kind of read.
//
// What it does that a list of rows does not: it renders `before`/`after` as a FIELD-LEVEL diff. Half
// the rows on a real tenant carry two full system prompts of ~11k characters each (measured on a
// self-hosted deployment, issue #401), and two JSON blobs there are not inconvenient, they are
// unreadable.
//
// IT DOES NOT RENDER `latestAt`, and that is a decision rather than an omission. The response still
// carries the trail-wide newest row for the REST and MCP transports, and this page used to print it
// above the filters as "Trail recorded up to", with help telling the operator to subtract a record's
// own `updatedAt` from it: a record newer than the line meant a change the trail had missed.
//
// Unfiltered, the line was a duplicate of the first card. Filtered, it was worse than useless for
// the one job it claimed, and the reason is that it is a MAXIMUM OVER THE WHOLE TRAIL. A row that
// fails to write is invisible to a global maximum unless it would have been the newest AND nothing
// has been recorded since — any later row from any other family carries the line past the gap, and
// the operator's subtraction then reads as "covered". It does not merely miss the case, it answers
// it wrongly.
//
// That case is REAL, and it is why this comment is not the shorter "audit writes are transactional".
// They are on every path this console can reach, but not on the MCP consent decision: `upsertApproval`
// commits, and `auditConsentDecision` then writes in its own transaction and swallows a failure with
// a warn (#528). The detector for that is the log line and the invariant, not a header that would
// have said "covered".
