// THE SAMPLE RESPONSE, KEPT FOR AS LONG AS THE TAB IS OPEN AND NOWHERE ELSE (issue #566).
//
// The Sample response field in the HTTP tool editor used to be cleared on every open, so an operator
// coming back to adjust a response template, the most common reason to reopen an HTTP tool, found
// pickers that offered nothing, no preview at all, and no "Insert a field" button. The two ways out
// were pasting a response again by hand or spending a real call against the customer's API to
// recover what had been on screen once.
//
// So it is remembered, in this tab, keyed by the tenant selector and the tool id. Closing the modal
// keeps it, and so does navigating to another page and back; a reload, a second tab and a logout do
// not.
//
// WHY NOTHING IS PERSISTED, ANYWHERE, WHICH IS THE WHOLE DESIGN. Two earlier drafts were taken apart
// in review, one for each place a value can be kept, and the two refusals are what this file is:
//
// 1. A REDACTED SHAPE OF THE RESPONSE IN A COLUMN, so the pickers would work on any machine. No
//    lexical rule establishes that a key is a field name rather than customer data:
//    `{"users": {"ana@example.com": …}}` is a map keyed by an e-mail, and `{"users": {"Ana": …}}` is
//    one keyed by a first name that any identifier pattern accepts. Since the keys cannot be
//    separated from the data, and a path THROUGH a map is worthless to an operator anyway (it
//    resolves for exactly one customer), there was nothing left worth storing.
// 2. THE RESPONSE IN `localStorage`. `docs/ui.md` carries a standing product rule that names this
//    case outright: localStorage is not admissible for product data, and "History, save, remember,
//    resume" all belong to a backend with `tenant_id` and RLS. A captured response is content data
//    and not a UI preference, and the copy would outlive every deletion that does not go through
//    this browser: a tool dropped over REST or MCP, or from another machine, leaves it behind.
//
// Both refusals point the same way, and the one place left to keep a value is the one the response
// already occupies while the modal is open. So it is never written down at all, which is what lets
// "we never store the customer's response" stand with no qualification: no column, no per-tool
// opt-in, no backup question, no export rule, no retention policy, and nothing a future reader has
// to re-derive before trusting it.
//
// WHAT THAT COSTS, stated rather than papered over: a reload, a second tab or a second machine gets
// what it gets today, which is no offer and "Send a test request" as the way back.
