// The console's CodeMirror field, with no language of its own (issue #562). Everything here is true
// of any language: the view built once, the controlled document, the accessibility attributes on the
// contenteditable, the placeholder, the character cap and the Escape claim. What the editor IS —
// the grammar, the completion source, the extra key bindings — arrives as `extensions` from the
// caller, in a compartment, so a rename in the arguments panel above reconfigures the source in
// place instead of tearing the editor down with the cursor and the undo history inside it.
//
// CodeMirror 6 rather than Monaco for one reason that is a property of this deployment and not a
// preference: the production CSP grants neither `unsafe-eval` nor `wasm-unsafe-eval`
// (src/api/lib/csp.ts), which Monaco needs and CodeMirror does not. CodeMirror's one requirement
// under a strict policy is an injected `<style>` element, and `styleSrc` already carries
// `'unsafe-inline'` in every environment, not only dev.
//
// The theme is written against the console's CSS CUSTOM PROPERTIES rather than against colours, so
// light mode costs nothing: `html[data-theme="light"]` swaps the variables and the editor follows,
// with no theme prop, no re-render and no second `EditorView.theme` to keep in step.

// A tiny highlight style, shared by every language this field is given. Deliberately six rules and
// not a full palette: the thing worth seeing at a glance is which words are STRINGS and which are
// structure, because an unterminated string is the mistake a textarea hides best — in a code body
