// the affordance is the part an operator learns once and then expects to find everywhere.
//
// A SPAN, NOT A BUTTON, and that is load-bearing rather than stylistic. A <label> is associated
// with the first LABELABLE element in its subtree, and `button` is labelable: as a button, this
// became the labelled control of any field it sat in: clicking the field's title opened the help
// instead of focusing the input, and the input lost its accessible name. Measured. `role="button"`
// plus `tabIndex` makes it interactive content (so a label forwards no click to it) without making
// it labelable, at the cost of wiring Enter and Space by hand, which a span does not emit as
// clicks. It is kept uniform outside labels too: one behaviour beats two variants that differ in a
// way nobody can see until it breaks.

  // COMPOSED and not interpolated, which is the unusual choice here and is deliberate. The two
  // halves are an action and its subject, in that order in both catalogues, and the subject arrives
  // already translated from whoever rendered the label. Interpolation would make the name of every
  // trigger depend on a `t` that interpolates, and in this suite one does not: nine client test
  // files stub `react-i18next` and the stub leaks across files (tests/lib/module-mock-package.test.ts
