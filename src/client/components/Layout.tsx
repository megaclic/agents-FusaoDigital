        {/* `relative` is load-bearing, and it is about `sr-only` rather than about anything
            this element positions. `sr-only` is `position: absolute`, so a screen-reader label
            anywhere in the page tree resolves against the nearest POSITIONED ancestor — and with
            this one static, that was the initial containing block, i.e. the document. A label far
            down the scrolled content stream then landed at that document coordinate and stretched
            `documentElement.scrollHeight` past the viewport, giving the page a SECOND scrollbar that
            scrolled the whole shell (header and sidebar) out of view.

            The scroller's own `overflow-y: auto` could not clip it either, by the same rule read
            from the other side: a scroll container only clips absolutely positioned descendants
            whose containing block is inside it. Measured on /audit with one row expanded, at
            1280x720: `document.scrollHeight` 2529 with this static, 720 with it relative (issue
            #511). Fixing the label instead would fix one instance of a class that ~20 files under
            src/client can reach. */}
