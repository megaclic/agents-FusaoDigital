// Label + control + (description | error) stack.

// THE LABEL POINTS AT THE CONTROL (`htmlFor`), it does not wrap it, and that is not a style
// preference: a wrapping <label> forwards a click on any NON-INTERACTIVE descendant to the control
// it labels. The `?` beside the title is a `<span role="button">`, and ARIA makes a span operable
// without making it *interactive content* in the HTML sense, so the label kept forwarding: measured
// on a field wrapping a checkbox, where clicking the `?` toggled the checkbox. The earlier version
// with a real <button> had the mirror-image defect, because `button` IS labelable and so became the
// labelled control, which took the input's accessible name with it.
//
// Pointing fixes a third thing on the way: a <label> that contains the control is as wide as the
// field, so the whole row, empty space included, was a click target. Now only the words are.
//
// The MESSAGE is a sibling for the same algorithm read the other way: an accessible name is
// computed from the whole label subtree, so a description or an error inside the label would be
// appended to the field's name instead of describing it. It reaches the control through
// `aria-describedby` (FormFieldContext) rather than through containment.
//
// Pass `group` when the children are NOT a single focusable control. There is nothing for `htmlFor`
// to name, so the wrapper carries `role="group"` + `aria-labelledby` instead, and the context hands
// down neither an id nor a label: a child that took the group's heading as its own name would be
// announced as the group.
