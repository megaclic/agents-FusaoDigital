// like Infinity does. Bounding the window at a day is well past any real throttle and puts every
// unrepresentable value on the other side of the check. The budgets are bounded for the mirror-image
// reason: an absurd ceiling is a bucket that never trips while reading as a configured one.

// NOTE: `Number.isInteger` is what makes the rest of this safe, not `> 0`. The pattern these budgets used to
// share (`RAW && Number(RAW) > 0 ? Number(RAW) : fallback`) accepts `Infinity`, and `1e309` parses to
// exactly that. Measured with an infinite window: the limiter advertises `RateLimit-Reset: NaN` and
// the bucket NEVER resets, so the endpoints it guards answer 429 permanently once the budget is
// spent. On a max instead of a window it is the mirror image, an unlimited bucket that reads as a
// configured one. `isInteger` refuses Infinity, NaN and fractions in one go.
