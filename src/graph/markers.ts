// The system markers that ride INSIDE messages of the graph memory thread.
//
// They live in a near-leaf module — messages only, no Prisma, no tenancy, no checkpointer — because
// the code that DECIDES where an attendance begins and ends (src/modules/memory/cut.ts) is a pure
// function over an array of messages, and it must stay that way.
//
// Why the markers are messages and not a SystemMessage: the agent node drops every system message
// from the history before the model call (src/graph/graph.ts), because a second system message is
// rejected outright by some providers. A system-role marker would therefore be invisible at exactly
// the moment it matters.
//
// RECOGNIZED BY METADATA, WRITTEN ONLY HERE. The marker text still travels in the content, because
// that is what the model reads, but nothing decides anything from that text. A customer whose message
// happens to start with one of these tags would otherwise be read as a system marker — and this repo
// is public, so "happens to" includes "chose to". The sharp end is the memory head: a message taken
// for the head is excluded from the summary and then REPLACED by the rendered head, so a customer's
// words would be deleted without ever having been summarized. Metadata cannot be typed into a chat.

//
// This is what the cut reads, and the divider is NOT. The divider is one message that somebody has to
// notice the need for, write in the right place, and keep: an invoke that started earlier saves the
// channel it loaded and erases it, ingestion only looked for the transition on customer messages, and
// the marker row recording "we already wrote one" advances independently of it. Each of those is a way
// for the boundary to end up somewhere the cut cannot find, and a boundary the cut cannot find merges
// two attendances into one summary, silently.
//
// A stamp has none of those failure modes: it is written with the message it describes, by whoever
// writes it, and an invoke that restores an older channel restores the stamps with it. Assistant
// replies are deliberately NOT stamped — they are built inside the graph, not by us — which is why the
// cut asks where the CURRENT attendance STARTS rather than where the previous one ended.
//
// Inert on the wire: the OpenAI, Google and Anthropic adapters read only known keys out of
// additional_kwargs (tool calls, thought signatures) and never spread the rest into the request.
