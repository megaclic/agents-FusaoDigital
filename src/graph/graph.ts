// text block that is empty ("text content blocks must be non-empty"), so a thread that accumulated
// one would stop answering entirely on the providers that check. Dropped from what the model is
// SENT, never from the channel — the marker is what keeps `lastAssistantText` reading "" instead of
// the skip tool's acknowledgement, which would otherwise be delivered to the customer as the reply.
//
// A message with tool_calls is not this, whatever its content: it is the call, and removing it
// orphans every `tool_call_id` after it.
//
// `invalid_tool_calls` is the opposite case, and the asymmetry is the point. A call that failed to
// parse is never executed, so `toolsCondition` ends the graph and no `ToolMessage` ever answers it —
// and `@langchain/openai` stores the RAW calls in `additional_kwargs.tool_calls` and replays those
// whenever `tool_calls` is empty, so keeping such a turn hands the provider an assistant tool call
// with no response and every later turn on that thread is rejected. Dropping it is what keeps the
// thread usable; a repair round, not a filter exception, is what would preserve the record.
//
// And "no TEXT" is not the question (round 31). A provider can answer with reasoning and nothing
// else, and Anthropic's `thinking` is signed; such a turn is output, not absence, and reading it as
// empty deletes from every later prompt exactly what `textlessContent` above takes such care to keep.
//
// BUT ONLY WHERE IT SURVIVES THE TRIP (round 2 of the follow-up). A non-text block is re-serialized
// by the vendor that emitted it and by nobody else: `@langchain/openai` builds an assistant message
// as `contentBlocks.filter(b => b.type === "text")`, so an Anthropic `thinking` block sent to OpenAI
// after a provider switch or a cross-vendor fallback arrives as `content: []` and the request is
// refused — the thread then stops answering entirely, which is worse than the context this keeps.
// So the exemption asks two things, and drops the turn (the pre-#455 behavior, always safe) whenever
// either is unanswerable: the block came from a provider that replays its own blocks, and EVERY
// model that can receive this turn is that same provider.
//
// ADDING A PROVIDER TO `models.ts` DOES NOT ADD IT HERE, and should not. Absence is the safe answer:
// the turn is dropped, which costs context and never breaks a thread. Membership is earned by
// reading how that vendor's adapter builds an assistant message from a `content` array — if it
// filters to text blocks, as `@langchain/openai` does, the vendor does NOT belong here however well
// it round-trips its own reasoning inside a single call.

  //     `ToolMessage` answers, and that thread is what the NEXT turn loads. `@langchain/openai`
  //     replays those calls out of `additional_kwargs` (issue #454), so the vendor is handed a call
  //     with no answer and rejects the whole history — the conversation stops working, which is a
  //     worse outcome than the write this refusal exists to prevent;
  //   - answering "refused" back INTO the model invites it to call the same tool again, round after
  //     round to the recursion limit, spending tokens on a conversation the operator has already
  //     cleared. So the graph ENDS here. The runtime's own gate refuses the send of a turn that was
  //     called off, which is what keeps this text out of the conversation.
  //
  // AND IT REFUSES BY RETURNING, NEVER BY THROWING, which is why the ask is wrapped. The contract in
  // ./reset-episode.ts reserves the throwing answer for seams that are asked "before anything is
  // written" — and by the time this node runs, the assistant turn carrying the calls is ALREADY
  // checkpointed. Measured against the real checkpointer with a tools node that throws: the thread
  // comes back `[human, ai(tool_calls=call_x)]`, no `ToolMessage`, which is the broken sequence
  // above, reached by the mechanism meant to prevent it. Several of the fences the runtime hands
  // down read a job row and throw on a database transient whatever the strictness, so this is not a
  // hypothetical caller.
