  //
  //   1. the entry, covering everything the caller did before this (asked immediately below);
  //   2. the thread claim, asked INSIDE the `ingest:` lock because that is what makes it sound, and
  //      handed that transaction's own connection because opening a second one there stalls the lock;
  //   3. the model invoke, asked once it returns, on the throw path as well as the clean one;
  //   4. the post-model ownership probe, whose answer the sends below consume;
  //   5. the moderation call inside deliverPromisedLine;
  //   6. the guardrail judge's call.
  //
  // A new end that writes needs no check of its own — it needs to be placed after one of these, with
  // no I/O in between, or to write through applyPostActions. A new WAIT does.

  // NOTE: Asked HERE, alongside the live gate and for its reason: before any model spend. It buys more
  // than the money, though — an invoked graph writes the proactive turn into the conversation's
