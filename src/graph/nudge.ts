  // once before the resolve, because the labels in between are two more round trips). No call site
  // asks on their behalf, and none can forget to — the contact-auth refusal is the end that proved

  //
  //   1. the entry, covering everything the caller did before this (asked immediately below);

  //   5. the moderation call inside deliverPromisedLine;
  //   6. the guardrail judge's call.

  // no I/O in between, or to write through applyPostActions. A new WAIT does.
