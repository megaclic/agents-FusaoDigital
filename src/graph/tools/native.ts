// THE MODEL'S LIST IS AN INTENT, NOT A WRITE. Between the read that produced `shown` (turn prep)
// and this call, another writer — an operator, an automation rule, the observer, n8n — can have
// added a label the model never saw. Sending `desired` as-is would erase it, which is the same
// class of bug as the unqueued read-then-POST that issue #477 closed, just with a wider window: a
// whole turn instead of two calls.
//
// So the intent is read as a DIFF against what the model saw, applied to what is standing now, and
// it is a diff in BOTH directions:
//
//   shown and left out  -> a removal;
//   asked for, not shown -> an addition;
//   shown AND asked for  -> the model said nothing about it, so neither.
//
// The third line is the one that is easy to get wrong, because the model writes those labels out
// again on every call — the tool asks it to, since leaving one out would delete it. Repeating a
// label is therefore NOT a request to have it; it is the absence of a request to lose it. Treating
// it as an addition puts back exactly what a concurrent writer has just removed: an operator peels
// `vip` off while the model generates, the model repeats `vip` merely to keep the rest, and the
// tool undoes the operator. That is the same class as erasing a concurrent ADD, which is what the
// removal half exists to prevent; both halves are the same rule, applied in the two directions.
//
// An unshown scope yields no removals at all and every label as an addition — the safe degenerate,
// because a model that cannot see what is there cannot mean "and nothing else".
//
// `added` and `removed` are then read off `next` rather than off the intent: they are what this
// write DID, and the intent and the write differ exactly in the unchanged-label case above.

  // snapshot, which is why the report states the resulting set.
  //
  // ONE BASELINE PER MODEL BATCH, and the batch is the unit because that is what the model saw.
  // LangGraph runs every tool call of one AIMessage concurrently and returns to the model only when
  // the whole batch is done, so two `set_labels` side by side were both written from the SAME
  // snapshot and neither could have read the other's result. A baseline taken per CALL lets the
  // second one see the first one's write recorded as "shown" and take it for a label it saw and
  // left out: `["a"]` and `["b"]` end as `b` alone.
  //
  // "Synchronously at the top of the handler" is not enough, and that is the whole reason this is
  // keyed rather than timed: `applyToolPreconditions` wraps the tool and AWAITS the state read
  // before this handler is entered, so with a precondition configured the second call can arrive
  // after the first has already written. Timing cannot separate the two cases; the batch key can.
  //
  // The key is LangGraph's own, measured rather than assumed: `langgraph_step` is identical for
  // every call of one batch and differs between batches (2, 2, 4 for two batches of a probe run),
  // and the namespace and thread go with it so a subgraph cannot collide with its parent. When
  // there is no config at all — a direct invocation in a test, the playground — there is no batch
  // to share and each call reads the live set, which is right because those calls ARE sequential.

// customer's phone — the muted transport refuses that POST, and reaching that refusal is a defect by
// construction — and an image is delivered by the turn's own gates, which an observation does not
// have, so it refuses every call. Offered anyway they cost a model round each and answer with a
// failure an operator reads as a broken integration. Read off the client's own `muted`, the same
// field `armReminders` asks, so the two cannot disagree about what this turn may do.
