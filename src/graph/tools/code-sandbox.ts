// Runs the body of an operator-authored code tool (tools/code.ts) where it can compute and decide,
// and cannot reach anything else (issue #363). The tool kind exists because a verdict left to the
// model is periodically wrong even when every number it holds is right: the CPF case that opened
// the issue had the two check digits computed correctly by `calculator` on every run and the model
// still answering "does not match". A body the OPERATOR wrote once, that RETURNS the verdict, leaves
// nothing for the model to compare and nothing for it to author: the model supplies arguments.
//
// Each call gets its own thread (code-sandbox.worker.ts) and the thread gets a fresh interpreter,
// which costs 13–16 ms measured end to end and buys three things the in-thread design could not:
//
//   - A runaway snippet never stalls the process. The interpreter's deadline is a poll, and until
//     it fires the CPU is busy; on the main thread that is the Chatwoot webhook's 5 s ack budget
//     shared with every other tenant's turn. Measured with `while(true){}` in flight: a 50 ms timer
//     on the main thread fired at 51 ms.
//   - The interpreter's own failure is contained. With the stack ceiling set high enough, a runaway
//     recursion overflowed the HOST stack before QuickJS could refuse it — a RangeError thrown out
//     of WASM, and an assertion abort on the next dispose. In a thread that is a dead thread; in the
//     process it is a corrupted module shared by every later call.
//   - `terminate()` is a hard stop that does not depend on the interrupt being polled.
//
// The limits below are the measured safe values. The stack budget is the one the ENGINE must reach
// before the thread's native stack does: the interrupt handler is a JS callback fired from inside
// the WASM frames every 10k opcodes, and JSC refuses to enter it past a depth (~2,400 interpreter
// frames on macOS) by throwing a RangeError through those frames. At 512 KiB the engine's own limit
// sat past that depth, and the runaway-recursion test only passed when no interrupt happened to
// fire deep — fewer than ~1,200 opcodes before the recursion; with more, `aborted`. At 448 KiB the
// engine came first; 256 KiB (~1,340 honest frames) leaves half the measured room, and the worker
// still maps the host's RangeError to the stack limit for a thread with less. The CPU deadline is
// polled and lands within a few ms of the figure.
