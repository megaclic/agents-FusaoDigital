// Operator-authored code tools (issue #363): a JavaScript function body the operator wrote once in
// the console, with a name, a description and a typed input schema, that the agent calls with
// arguments. The body runs in the sandbox (code-sandbox.ts) as `function (input, context)` and
// answers with `return`; the model supplies `input` and nothing else. The kind exists because a
// verdict left to the model is periodically wrong even when every number it holds is right, and
// because a body the MODEL wrote per turn only moved that error into the authorship (measured on
// PR #485: 2 of 6 CPF algorithms written by gpt-4o-mini were wrong, each returning a confident
// `false`). A rule written once by the tenant is where the rule stops varying.
//
// What the body sees besides `input`: `context`, the same variables an HTTP tool's `{{context}}`
// placeholders read (conversation_id, message_id, contact_*, inbox_*, company_name, agent_name)
// plus the two attribute bags a precondition reads at call time (`conversationAttributes`,
// `contactAttributes` — modules/agents/tool-preconditions.ts is the one vocabulary for both, and
// reconciling there rather than growing a second one is what that file asks for). The bags are read
// when the tool is CALLED, not when the turn is built: the customer gives the value,
// `set_custom_attribute` writes it, and the code tool that reads it runs in the same turn.
//
// Not in the same BATCH, though, and the limit is the same one a precondition over those bags has:
// `ToolNode` runs one message's tool calls with `Promise.all`, so a `set_custom_attribute` and a
// code tool the model emitted TOGETHER race, and the read can land first. What holds is ordering
// between steps — the model reads the write's result and calls the tool in its next message.
//
// A failure of the body — it does not parse, it throws, it hits a limit — is the OPERATOR's, not
// the model's: the model cannot rewrite the body, and a rule that fails silently is the failure this
// kind exists to remove. So it is a ToolFailure (failure.ts): the model reads a short sentence and
// answers without the tool, the flow log records the call at warn with the reason as its first
// line, and the alert channels carry it to the operator. `unavailable` (the sandbox itself could
// not start) is a failure for the same reason. Only a value is a normal result.
