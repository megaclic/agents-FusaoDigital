// WHAT A PROACTIVE TURN LEAVES BEHIND WHEN IT IS REFUSED AFTER IT WAS GENERATED.
//
// `runAgentNudge` invokes the graph, and the graph checkpoints as it runs: the nudge directive and
// the assistant's answer are in the thread's history the moment `invoke` returns. Every refusal that
// comes AFTER that point suppresses the send and leaves the pair there: an operator took the
// conversation, a `/reset` retired the job, the agent was switched off mid-turn. The customer never
// received the message, and the NEXT turn reads it as something they did, and answers "as I
// mentioned" about a sentence nobody was shown (issue #251).
//
// Measured before this module existed, against the test database, with the job retired during
// generation:
//
//   OUTCOME: stale   SENT TO CUSTOMER: []
//   channel: [human] An external system event just occurred…   [ai] Oi, ainda precisa de ajuda?
//
// Removing it is the only shape that leaves the history equal to what the customer received. The two
// alternatives were weighed and rejected in the issue: DELIVERING what was generated is wrong in the
// direction that matters (the refusals exist precisely because the conversation stopped being ours to
// write in), and MARKING the turn as undelivered keeps the text in every prompt from here on and
// makes every reader of the history responsible for understanding the mark.
//
// The mechanism is the one memory compaction already uses (src/modules/memory/compact.ts): name the
// ids, never REMOVE_ALL_MESSAGES, so a message that arrived from anywhere else is left alone.

// A tool call is the line between a turn that only SAID something and one that DID something. The
// transfer is the case that forces it: `handoffAnsweredTheTurn` hands the conversation to the human
// queue from inside the graph, and `runAgentNudge` says so in its own words: "the transfer itself
// still stands: the tool ran inside the graph and this fence was never able to reverse it". Erasing
// the turn would erase the only record of an act that really happened, to the outside world, and no
// removal here can undo. So the question is asked of the whole slice and answered conservatively:
// any tool call at all, and the turn stays.
// `skip_reply` is the one tool that acts on NOTHING — it is the decision to stay quiet, and since
// #454 it is how a follow-up says so. Counting it as an action pins a refused turn's directive and
// tool result in shared memory after a `/reset`, a takeover, or any post-generation refusal: exactly
// the residue this planner exists to clear, and now reachable through the silence protocol itself.
// A NAME IS NOT AN IDENTITY HERE EITHER, and this one is a real collision rather than a hypothetical:
// `toolDefinitionCreateSchema` does not reserve the native names, so an agent with native tools
// disabled can grant a custom HTTP tool called `skip_reply` that really does call something. Judging
// by name alone would let a refused turn be removed after that call went out, which is the exact case
// `actedOnTheWorld` exists to preserve. So the CALLER — the only side that knows which tool was
// actually bound — passes the set, and an empty set means nothing was inert.
//
// THE SECOND WAY A CALL PERFORMS NOTHING is that it never ran at all (issue #449): the graph's tool
// boundary refuses a batch when the turn was called off mid-invoke and answers each call with a
// marked `ToolMessage`. That one is not a set of NAMES and could not be — the refusal covers every
// tool source, so the names are whatever the operator granted — and it is not the content either,
// since a tool is free to return the same sentence. It is the marker only the graph writes.
//
// PAIRED BY POSITION, WHICH IS WHAT THE MECHANISM ACTUALLY IS. The boundary refuses a BATCH: it
// either answers every call of the assistant turn it just read, or none of them, and it emits those
// answers directly after that turn. So the assistant turn a refusal follows is the one whose calls
// did not run.
//
// Pairing by `tool_call_id` was the first version of this and it read the wrong axis. A provider may
// emit a call with no id — LangChain types it optional — and the refusal then carries `""`, which
// matches no call: the turn came back as "a tool ran" and the cancelled nudge stayed in shared
// memory, which is the defect this branch exists to close (review round 3).
//
// Positional rather than "the slice contains a refusal", because a turn can run a tool on one hop
// and be refused on the NEXT: that first result is a real act and the slice has to stay whole.

// Reads the channel and writes the removal under the SAME key the append and the compaction rewrite
// take (`ingest:<graphThreadId>`), so the read and the write are one step as far as those two are
// concerned.
//
// THE QUEUE IS NOT ENOUGH, AND THE COUNT IS WHY. A turn takes that key to mark itself and RELEASES
// it before the model runs, so an invoke in flight is not holding anything this could queue behind.
// What it is holding is a claim in `src/graph/inflight.ts`, and the hazard that registry exists for
// is exactly this one: an invoke is a read-modify-write of the WHOLE channel, so one that loaded the
// refused turn will save it back the moment it finishes, undoing a removal written underneath it.
//
// Memory compaction answers this by reading the count before adding its own claim and standing down
// (`isTurnInFlight` -> "busy"), and so does this. The difference is what standing down costs: a
// deferred compaction runs again at the next attendance boundary, and a deferred rollback has no
// later, so the refused turn stays in the history. That is the honest outcome rather than a better
// one: writing a removal that another invoke is about to undo leaves the same history and a
// checkpoint that says otherwise. It is named and logged so the case is visible instead of silent.
//
// The nudge's own claim is already released by the time any refusal reaches here (the `finally` that
// clears it sits above them all), so this never stands down on account of itself.
//
// AND THE MAP IS NOT ENOUGH EITHER, WHICH IS WHAT `owner` IS FOR. `isTurnInFlight` is a Map in ONE
// process, and on the topology docs/deploy.md §4 sanctions — extra web replicas, workers on one
// leader — the turn runs wherever the webhook landed. A caller reaches this line just after
// releasing its own durable claim (it has to: the check above would otherwise read that claim and
// stand down on itself), so the moment this runs is exactly the moment another replica may start.
//
// THIS IS AN APPEND, so it takes the claim appends take. Writing to the message channel from outside
// an invoke is what `claimIngestWrite` exists to fence (thread-claim.ts), and it is the same shape:
// a bounded read-plan-write, not a model turn. Held, a turn STARTING on any replica waits for it and
// then loads a channel the sentinel has already left; held by someone else, this stands down under
// the name it already had. The durable TURN claim would not have done: `turn_holders` is counted, so
// two turns share a thread by design and holding one excludes no other turn at all.
//
// WHERE IT STILL STOPS. An invoke ALREADY reading the channel cannot be excluded by anything here —
// it will save back what it loaded — and a thread with no `contactInboxId` has no row to hang a
// claim on, so the fallback key keeps the Map alone. Losing either race costs exactly what happens
// with no rollback: the refused turn stays in the history. Best-effort against a concurrent invoke,
// and never worse than not having run.
