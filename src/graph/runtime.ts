    //        if it had ended. The lock — the same one ingestion takes on this thread — makes exactly
    //        one turn the claimant.
    //      - The marker must not advance without the divider landing. It used to advance here while
    //        the divider only reached the checkpointer if the invoke ran, so an input guardrail that
    //        answered before the model, or a throw, left a boundary nothing could ever find again.
    //        Writing the divider inside the claim removes the dependency on the turn succeeding.
    //      - And with the divider durable at claim time, compaction can be armed right here instead of
    //        waiting for the invoke.
    //
    //    The divider being its own message (the ingestion mechanism, same graph) is also why the
    //    guardrails now see the customer's raw words on BOTH directions: there is no longer a turn text
