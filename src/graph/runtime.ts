// non-delivery, what "stale" means for a claim, what a restored predecessor does to a later retry,
// and whether an in-flight claim may be read as an answer. It belongs in an issue of its own.

  //   4. the bot still holds the conversation  `botOwnsItNow` — a human took it over mid-turn
  //   5. something to acknowledge  — inside `markRead`, which does not call on an empty list

  // one CLAIMS the burst as its CAS, advancing the handled watermark; a tick that claimed would mark
  // messages handled on the way to acknowledging them, which is the defect the watermark rule exists
  // to prevent. A receipt observes, it does not consume.

  // owns it" and "cannot tell" are the same answer to a customer-visible claim made by a bot that

  // the newer message's own turn advances past it. Best-effort — a watermark miss must not fail the
  // turn.
  // "stale" ADVANCES IT, and used not to. It was excluded when nothing on this path could produce
  // it, on the reasoning that a called-off run withdraws its message rather than handling it — which
  // is the flush's truth, where a re-armed flush answers the burst, and not this path's. Here the
  // only thing that calls a run off is the operator's own /reset (./reset-episode.ts), nothing else
  // is coming for the message, and the receiver settles its ledger row as CONSUMED. The watermark
  // has to agree with the ledger: left behind, the row is terminal while the watermark still sits
  // below the message, and the first flush after debounce is enabled re-answers it (issue #8).
  //
  // Not covered by the command's own advance, which is the shape a review round measured: /reset
  // writes the boundary in its FIRST step and advances this watermark in its LAST, with a dozen
  // Chatwoot calls in between, so a process dying in that stretch leaves exactly the gap above.
