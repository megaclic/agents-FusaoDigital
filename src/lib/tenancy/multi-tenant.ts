// A SUPER_ADMIN's target tenant is the only tenant id that reaches this boundary from OUTSIDE the
// process: it comes from a per-request selector (the `X-Tenant-Id` header, which the console persists
// in the browser, or an MCP call's `tenant` argument), so it can name a tenant that no longer exists.
// Every context this process builds for itself carries an id it just read from a row, and carries
// TENANT_ADMIN, which is what makes the role the whole predicate.
//
// Unverified, that id is not an error anywhere, which is the problem. RLS scopes the transaction to a
// tenant with no rows, so a READ answers with defaults (a settings screen loads empty, looking
// healthy) and a WRITE fails inside Prisma (measured: P2025 on an update, P2003 on an insert).
// Neither of those is an AppError, so `onError` falls through to its generic branch and the operator
// is told "something went wrong", with no reason, on a screen whose data was never real. Issue #223.
//
// The MCP transport already asks this question, per call, before it builds the principal
// (`resolveTenantSelector`, answering "Tenant not found"). Same question, same answer, so the two
// transports cannot diverge.
//
// They diverged anyway, twice, and both times the same way: a REST controller unwrapped the request
// context down to `ctx.tenantId` and handed the bare id to a module that rebuilt a TENANT_ADMIN
// context around it, so this check saw an internal id and skipped. #268 was the playground; #280 was
// knowledge/RAG, experiments, integrations, documents and the n8n export. Nothing here can catch
// that — the lie is well-formed by the time it arrives — so the fence is on the transport, where the
// provenance is still known: `tests/modules/tenant-selector-entry-points.test.ts`.
//
// One statement, in a transaction that is already open, and only where the id is unverified. Asking
// at the request boundary instead would cost a transaction of its own on every request the fleet
// operator makes, and the first-run operator of EVERY installation is a SUPER_ADMIN.

// checkpointer, which has its own pool and its own connections, from in here, and the rule read as satisfied
// because nothing was calling an HTTP API. It cost the same: a connection held idle-in-transaction
// across another pool's round-trips, this pool drained, and every unrelated query failing on
// `maxWait` (issue #225). If `fn` awaits anything that is not this transaction, it does not belong.
//

// given time" is `maxWait`; "a query cannot be executed on an expired transaction" is `timeout`),

// `set_config('role', ...)` rather than `SET LOCAL ROLE`: it is the same transaction-local

// caller input — `FLEET_ROLE_FN` is a constant of this repository — and the name it resolves to
// never leaves the server.
//
// It is not a privilege escalation the old GUC did not already allow: reaching this needs a
// statement on the runtime connection, which is what setting the GUC needed too. What DID change is
// that the GUC now grants nothing at all, so the old spelling fails closed rather than silently
// still working — `tests/lib/rls-policy-shape.test.ts` asserts that.
