//
// Both bounds exist because of the same slip, measured in issue #464: an `AbortController` armed
// for the fetch and cleared in the `finally` of that fetch is a bound on the RESPONSE HEADERS. The
// body is read afterwards, outside it, with nothing left to end it — under a 300ms bound a
// provider that answered at once and then stalled was still pending at 3,002ms, and mid-turn that
// is a tool call that never returns. `.text()` has no size bound either: the same probe took
// 1,438 MiB of resident memory from a single call, three seconds in and still climbing.
//
// So the fetch and the body read live inside one `try`, under one timer, and the read keeps only a
// prefix. Callers get the text, never the unread `Response`, which is what makes the bound
// impossible to step outside of by accident: there is no second read to forget to cover.
//
// `src/modules/chatwoot/client.ts` reaches the time half a different way — `AbortSignal.timeout()`
// stays armed through the body read, with no timer to clear — and needs nothing from here.
