// Every action name the code can write, for the console's action filter.
//
// It lives HERE, beside `markers.ts` and for the same reason: a module that imports nothing, so the
// browser bundle can read it without dragging a `src/modules` file across the boundary
// `tests/client/bundle-boundary.test.ts` guards.
//
// WHY A CONSTANT AND NOT `SELECT DISTINCT action`. The distinct query answers a better question —
// what this deployment has actually recorded — and pays for it with a scan: `audit_logs` only grows,
// its only index leads with `tenant_id, created_at`, and nothing leads with `action`. The filter
// would get slower exactly on the trails long enough to need filtering. A constant costs nothing and
// is wrong only in one direction, which the filter answers on its own: the combo box accepts free
// text, so a name this list does not carry is still reachable by typing it.
//
// WHAT KEEPS THE LIST HONEST IS THE TYPE, not the sweep. `AuditEntry.action` is `AuditAction` rather
// than `string`, so an action absent from here does not compile — the same argument the file already
// makes one field over for `actorType`. That matters because the sweep in
// `tests/modules/audit-actions.test.ts` reads what is written after `action:`, and an action reaches
// `recordAudit` by other roads: a ternary picking between two names (`company_logo.*`), and a local
// helper taking the name as an argument (`auditConsentDecision`, which the first version of that
// sweep missed entirely, leaving two live actions off the picker). A regex can be taught each shape
// after it is found; the type has no shapes.
//
// The sweep still earns its place on the OTHER direction, which no type can check: an entry here
// whose producer was deleted is a value the operator can pick that will never match a row.

  // writes them any more — the two above replaced them — and no row has moved, which is the whole
  // shape of this release rather than an omission.
  //
  // The rename and the backfill cannot ship together, and the reason is the deploy rather than the
  // code. The rollout overlaps: the incoming container runs `prisma migrate deploy` while the
  // outgoing one is still serving, and that one's catalog is FROZEN with only these two names. Move
  // the rows in the same release and its picker offers two values that now match nothing, so the
  // consent family reads as empty on the old container for the length of the upgrade — and
  // indefinitely after a rollback, which is a thing operators do when a release misbehaves.
  //
  // So this release only teaches every reader both spellings, and the backfill is the next one,
  // where the oldest live catalog already has all four. Both of these leave with it.
  //
  // WHAT IS ACCEPTED, DELIBERATELY, is the other side of the same frozen catalog: a decision taken
  // AFTER this upgrade is written under a dotted name the previous image does not list, so rolling
  // back to it hides those decisions from the picker until you roll forward again. Nothing is lost
  // — the rows are there, and the next release's backfill puts every one of them under one name.
  // Closing that too would mean listing the new names one release before anything writes them,
  // which puts a value in the operator's picker that matches nothing at all, and then a third
  // release to finish; a cosmetic rename does not buy three. It goes in the release notes, the way
  // the `tts.normalize` default did.
