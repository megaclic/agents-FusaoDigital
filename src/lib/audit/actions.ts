// Every action name the code can write, for the console's action filter.
//
// It lives HERE, beside `markers.ts` and for the same reason: a module that imports nothing, so the
// browser bundle can read it without dragging a `src/modules` file across the boundary
// `tests/client/bundle-boundary.test.ts` guards.
//
// WHY A CONSTANT AND NOT `SELECT DISTINCT action`. The distinct query answers a better question —
// what this deployment has actually recorded — and pays for it with a scan: `audit_logs` only grows,
// its only index leads with `tenant_id, created_at`, and nothing leads with `action`. The filter
// would get slower exactly on the trails long enough to need filtering. A constant costs nothing and
// is wrong only in one direction, which the filter answers on its own: the combo box accepts free
// text, so a name this list does not carry is still reachable by typing it.
//
// WHAT KEEPS THE LIST HONEST IS THE TYPE, not the sweep. `AuditEntry.action` is `AuditAction` rather
// than `string`, so an action absent from here does not compile — the same argument the file already
// makes one field over for `actorType`. That matters because the sweep in
// `tests/modules/audit-actions.test.ts` reads what is written after `action:`, and an action reaches
// `recordAudit` by other roads: a ternary picking between two names (`company_logo.*`), and a local
// helper taking the name as an argument (`auditConsentDecision`, which the first version of that
// sweep missed entirely, leaving two live actions off the picker). A regex can be taught each shape
// after it is found; the type has no shapes.
//
// The sweep still earns its place on the OTHER direction, which no type can check: an entry here
// whose producer was deleted is a value the operator can pick that will never match a row.

// THE DOOR THE RENAME LEFT OPEN BEHIND IT, and it is a door, not a name.
//
// #555 moved every consent row off the two pre-#392 spellings and took them out of the catalog
// above, which is the point of that change: one act, one name, one row the operator can pick. What
// the removal ALSO does is turn every filter link somebody saved, every script that hard-codes the
// query string and every export quoted under the old spelling into a read that matches nothing —
// an audit trail answering "no consent decision was ever recorded" while the rows sit one name over.
// That is the shape this subsystem refuses everywhere else (`buildAuditWhere`'s neighbours, the 403
// on a scope rather than a narrowed answer, #520): an empty result is a sentence, and it must not be
// said when it is false. The empty CSV handed to a customer is the sharp end of it.
//
// So an old spelling is accepted as INPUT and redirected here. It is never in `AUDIT_ACTIONS`, never
// written by a producer, and never carried by a row that comes back — it exists only to point a
// reader who learned the name before the rename at the rows that name now lives on.
//
// `docs/deploy.md` covers the OTHER half of the same window, and the two are not the same case: an
// old image's frozen catalog also reads as empty, but that one is transient and closes by rolling
// forward. A saved link does not close by itself, which is why this one is code and that one is a
// note.
// A MAP AND NOT AN OBJECT LITERAL, because the input here is the operator's, arriving off a URL.
// `?action=toString` is a string like any other, and a plain-object lookup answers it with an
// INHERITED member — a function, which `?? action` then keeps because it is not nullish. That value
// reaches Prisma as the `action` filter, where this endpoint promises an empty result and would
// answer a 500, and reaches the page's filter state, which expects a string. A `Map` has no
// inherited keys to find, so the whole class is gone rather than guarded at one call site.

// are not filtered out of the tenant read — they are unreachable through it.

// The picker still offers them, because the picker is the write vocabulary and hiding a family is
