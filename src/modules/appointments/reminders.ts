// invoke — tool calls included — so on a thread keyed by contact inbox the command cannot land
// between these two writes at all. What is left is the keys with no row to claim, where the fence is
// still the in-process Map. There, recording FIRST would leave the one pair that is worse than the
// code this replaces: the record cancelled while reminders that arm a moment later are not, so the
// follow-up pause is off while a reminder still reaches the customer. Recording LAST cannot produce

// ALL rows, not just PENDING ones: `loadAppointmentContext` re-reads fired rows too, and a fired

// cancelling marks a job DONE, which is indistinguishable from "fired". One atomic statement, never

// The calendar event itself is deliberately NOT touched. Deleting a real booking is not what the

//
// UNCONDITIONAL, and that is why the caller runs it BEFORE its slow work rather than after. /reset is
// not atomic with the conversation: a turn arriving during the cleanup can book or reschedule, and
// retiring what that turn armed loses reminders for real appointments (the command also clears
// `lastInboundAt`, so nothing re-arms them). Sparing them by age does not work — enqueueJob upserts on
// `reminder:<eventId>:<offset>`, so a reschedule keeps the row's `created_at` and a claim moves its
// `updated_at`; both columns answer a question about the ROW, not about the arm. Ordering answers it
// instead: retire first, and an arm that lands afterwards revives its own row, because that same
// upsert writes `status: PENDING` with a fresh payload and run time. What is left is the window
// between reading the command and this statement committing, where "before or after the command" has
// no answer to get right.
//
// TWO scopes in one statement, over different row sets. The `cancelledAt` stamp is the APPOINTMENT's
// cancel marker, not a note about a run: projectAppointmentEvents and the follow-up sweep both read
// it, and to both a row whose start is still ahead is a LIVE appointment until the stamp lands. So it
// goes on every row of the thread, DEAD ones included — fencing it on status would leave a
// dead-lettered reminder in the prompt, and follow-ups paused on it, after the operator was told the
// conversation had been cleared. The STATUS transition is the narrower scope: only a queued or
// in-flight row has a run to call off, and moving a DEAD row to DONE would erase the dead-letter an
// operator may still need to read (the same reason retireJobsByDedupeKey fences the whole statement —
// there the stamp has no reader but jobRetired, so it can).
