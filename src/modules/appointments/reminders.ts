// already-fired rows keep the OLD thread; going from a fired row's event id back to the whole
// `reminder:<eventId>:` prefix would cancel and tombstone the LIVE reminders of the conversation that
// now owns the appointment. The thread predicate is the same lookup `loadAppointmentContext` uses per
// turn, and it cannot reach outside the conversation that typed the command.
//
// ALL rows, not just PENDING ones: `loadAppointmentContext` re-reads fired rows too, and a fired
// reminder whose start is still ahead is exactly what keeps the appointment block in the prompt after
// the operator was told the conversation was cleared. The tombstone is what tells the two apart —
// cancelling marks a job DONE, which is indistinguishable from "fired". One atomic statement, never
// read-modify-write, so a concurrent re-arm's payload is stamped or replaced whole.
//
// The calendar event itself is deliberately NOT touched. Deleting a real booking is not what the
// operator asked for by typing /reset, and it is not undoable.
//
// UNCONDITIONAL, and that is why the caller runs it BEFORE its slow work rather than after. /reset is
// not atomic with the conversation: a turn arriving during the cleanup can book or reschedule, and
// retiring what that turn armed loses reminders for real appointments (the command also clears
// `lastInboundAt`, so nothing re-arms them). Sparing them by age does not work — enqueueJob upserts on
// `reminder:<eventId>:<offset>`, so a reschedule keeps the row's `created_at` and a claim moves its
// `updated_at`; both columns answer a question about the ROW, not about the arm. Ordering answers it
// instead: retire first, and an arm that lands afterwards revives its own row, because that same
// upsert writes `status: PENDING` with a fresh payload and run time. What is left is the window
// between reading the command and this statement committing, where "before or after the command" has
// no answer to get right.
//
// TWO scopes in one statement, over different row sets. The `cancelledAt` stamp is the APPOINTMENT's
// cancel marker, not a note about a run: projectAppointmentEvents and the follow-up sweep both read
// it, and to both a row whose start is still ahead is a LIVE appointment until the stamp lands. So it
// goes on every row of the thread, DEAD ones included — fencing it on status would leave a
// dead-lettered reminder in the prompt, and follow-ups paused on it, after the operator was told the
// conversation had been cleared. The STATUS transition is the narrower scope: only a queued or
// in-flight row has a run to call off, and moving a DEAD row to DONE would erase the dead-letter an
// operator may still need to read (the same reason retireJobsByDedupeKey fences the whole statement —
// there the stamp has no reader but jobRetired, so it can).
//
