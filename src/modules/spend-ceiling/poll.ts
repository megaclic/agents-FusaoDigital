// THE POLL THAT WRITES WHAT THE GATE READS (issue #426).
//
// The ceiling is denominated in dollars and the dollars come from Langfuse, which keeps the price
// table. This is deliberately not "the gate asks Langfuse": that would put a scoped transaction, a
// vault decryption and an HTTP round trip with a ten-second timeout in front of every customer
// message, and the error branch has no good answer — failing open spends without limit, which is
// what the feature prevents, and failing closed lets a third-party outage silence every agent of the
// tenant. So a job reads the month's cost per source into `spend_cost_snapshots`, and the gate reads
// the row. A Langfuse outage costs STALENESS, and staleness is a failure the row can be honest about:
// `polledAt` is the last success, `pollError` the last failure, and the two never overwrite each
// other.
//
// One query per source. The two sources are told apart on the Langfuse side by the trace's
// ENVIRONMENT (`environmentForSource`: `<env>` for inbox, `<env>-playground` for the playground),
// which is a filterable column of the metrics API and the same split the Langfuse UI's environment
// selector makes. Both queries are fenced to THE TENANT by the trace's `userId`, the tenant's slug:
// the environment is deployment-wide, and a project two tenants share would otherwise be summed
// into both months (review round 2). The window is the calendar month, closed at both ends, from
// `monthStart` to the instant of the poll.
//
// THE FIGURE IS MONOTONIC INSIDE A MONTH. Langfuse ingests asynchronously and the lag correlates
// with load, so during the burst the ceiling exists for a total can read LOWER than the last one: a
// burst that has not landed yet is money never spent. A lower answer is therefore not written over
// a higher one, and the counts follow the same rule. The cost that buys is one-sided and bounded by
// the lag: the figure catches up on the next poll, and never runs ahead.
//
// THE RECONCILIATION SHIPS WITH IT. Langfuse prices a model it does not know at ZERO, silently, so a
// tenant on OpenRouter or a self-hosted endpoint would get a ceiling that never trips — worse than
// none, because the screen says it is enforcing. The same query groups by model and counts, so a
// model with calls and no cost is named on the row (`unpricedModels`), and the console compares
// what Langfuse costed against what the local ledger recorded.

    // the row.
