// PER-TENANT SPEND CEILING, read from the free-form `tenant.settings.spendCeiling` bag (issue #146;
// denominated in money since #426).
//
// Nothing in the system could refuse a model call because a tenant had spent enough: `LlmUsage` is
// an accurate ledger written AFTER each call, and every reader of it is a projection. The first
// time an operator learned a month had gone wrong was the dashboard, or the provider's invoice.
//
// COUNTED IN DOLLARS, because the invoice is. The first version counted tokens, and a token count
// cannot be made to track a bill: output is billed several times higher than input on every
// provider, a cached read is a discounted subset of the prompt, and a token on a small model and a
// token on a frontier model are orders of magnitude apart. The figure comes from Langfuse, which
// keeps the price table, read by a periodic job into a local snapshot the gate reads
// (./poll.ts, ./service.ts). The trade that buys: the ceiling is enforceable only where Langfuse is
// configured for the tenant, and the console says so where it is not.
//
// TWO CEILINGS, because the ledger already separates the two kinds of traffic and they fail
// differently. Real customer traffic is driven by how many people write in, which is the variable
// the operator does not control; the playground is one operator testing a prompt in a loop, which
// is the cheapest way to discover there was no ceiling at all. A single ceiling would let the
// second one lock the first out of answering customers.

  // ceiling is per TENANT, and a tenant spans as many Chatwoot accounts as it has instances, so a

  // and the ceiling goes from allowed straight to over and the `over` line is the first one written.
  // Same bound as the overshoot, from the same read-then-act shape (docs/spend-ceiling.md); the band

  // why, so the console can tell the operator the number they typed is not the number being
  // enforced. Derived on read, never stored: the writer's schema does not carry it, and the first

// what the handoff actually DOES — it opens the conversation for humans, it pages nobody. So
// "encaminhei" is true and the "já avisei a equipe, e alguém continua por aqui" it replaces was
// not: it claimed an active notice and a present human, and the handoff delivers neither. The pair
// is only true together, though, and the two fields are independent on the screen: an operator who
// turns the handoff off and leaves this text ships a promise nothing keeps, and nothing warns them.
//
// What it deliberately does not do: name a deadline (the ceiling holds until the month turns or the
// operator raises it) and invite a retry (retrying cannot help, and the customer spends their

//
// And it falls back to the DEFAULT, which for the ceilings is `0`, which is "no ceiling on this
// half". Said plainly because it is the direction the whole feature takes and it deserves to be
// read as a choice rather than found as a surprise: a `-1` that reached this column out of band
// leaves the block enabled and bounding nothing. The alternative is to invent a positive number,
// and a ceiling nobody typed is a ceiling that silences an agent for real customers on the strength
// of corrupted data — the same trade the unreadable-snapshot path already makes in the same
// direction, one level up. It is not silent, either: the console renders exactly what this returns,
// so an operator looking at the ceiling screen sees the zero.
//
// AND IT CLAMPS TO THE MAXIMUM THE WRITER ENFORCES, so this reader can never return a block the
// writer would refuse. That is not the two sides collapsing into one question — one still answers
// "what is stored" and the other "may this be stored" — it is the round trip between them. A value
// past the maximum can only arrive out of band (an import, a hand-edited column), and
// `updateSpendCeiling` merges THIS output with the operator's patch before validating the merge, so
// passing it through would 422 every save on the screen over a field the operator never touched,
// with nothing rendered that they could fix. Each clamp runs toward the safe side of its own field:
// a notice that speaks more often, a ceiling that is lower.
//
// The sibling blocks in `tenant-settings/service.ts` hold the same invariant by a different trade:
// they run the strict schema itself, partial, and fall back to the DEFAULTS for the whole block when
// any field fails. This one reads field by field on purpose, so one bad number does not discard an
// operator's message and ceilings along with it, and per-field clamping is what that costs.
