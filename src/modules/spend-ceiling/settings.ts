// PER-TENANT TOKEN CEILING, read from the free-form `tenant.settings.spendCeiling` bag (issue #146).
//
// Nothing in the system could refuse a model call because a tenant had spent enough: `LlmUsage` is
// an accurate ledger written AFTER each call, and every reader of it is a projection. The first
// time an operator learned a month had gone wrong was the dashboard, or the provider's invoice.
//
// COUNTED IN TOKENS, not in currency, and that is the one decision the shape rests on. Cost in this
// codebase comes from Langfuse (src/modules/analytics/langfuse-costs.ts), which is optional and
// asynchronous, and the dashboard already treats a zero-cost series as "ingestion lag, or pricing
// not configured" rather than "spent nothing". A gate cannot be built on a number that is optional,
// lagging, and legitimately zero. Tokens are written by our own callback and are queryable on an
// index that already exists.
//
// TWO CEILINGS, because the ledger already separates the two kinds of traffic and they fail
// differently. Real customer traffic is driven by how many people write in, which is the variable
// the operator does not control; the playground is one operator testing a prompt in a loop, which
// is the cheapest way to discover there was no ceiling at all. A single ceiling would let the
// second one lock the first out of answering customers.

export interface SpendCeilingConfig {
  enabled: boolean;
  // Tokens allowed per CALENDAR MONTH for `inbox` traffic, counted as prompt + completion. That
  // sum already INCLUDES the cached reads, because a cached read is a discounted subset of the
  // prompt tokens rather than a separate charge; adding the cached column on top would count the
  // same token twice (see `tokensUsedSince`). 0 = no ceiling on this half, which is what an
  // operator who only wants to bound the playground writes.

  // per-agent gate it is modelled on. A Chatwoot team id belongs to ONE account, and contact-auth
  // carries the account alongside it precisely so a pinned team is ignored in the wrong one. This
  // ceiling is per TENANT, and a tenant spans as many Chatwoot accounts as it has instances, so a
  // single stored team would be meaningless in every account but one. Chatwoot's own inbox routing
  // already answers the question for all of them.

  // ceiling, so the operator hears about it before the agent goes quiet rather than after. 0 = no

  //
  // "At or past", not "on the way past": the fraction is evaluated by the gate, on the ledger as it
  // stood BEFORE the turn, so a single turn that spends more than the band between the fraction and
  // the ceiling goes from allowed straight to over and the `over` line is the first one written.
  // Same bound as the overshoot, from the same read-then-act shape (docs/spend-ceiling.md); the band
  // is what buys the lead time, and lowering the fraction is what buys more of it.

//
// It is written against the `handoffEnabled: true` two lines below, and the verb is picked to match
// what the handoff actually DOES — it opens the conversation for humans, it pages nobody. So
// "encaminhei" is true and the "já avisei a equipe, e alguém continua por aqui" it replaces was
// not: it claimed an active notice and a present human, and the handoff delivers neither. The pair
// is only true together, though, and the two fields are independent on the screen: an operator who
// turns the handoff off and leaves this text ships a promise nothing keeps, and nothing warns them.
//
// What it deliberately does not do: name a deadline (the ceiling holds until the month turns or the
// operator raises it) and invite a retry (retrying cannot help, and the customer spends their
// patience learning that).

// A token ceiling is a count, so anything that is not a non-negative whole number is not one. FALLS
// BACK rather than throws, like every other block in this bag: a malformed write must never be able
// to break the webhook.
//
// And it falls back to the DEFAULT, which for the two token fields is `0`, which is "no ceiling on
// this half". Said plainly because it is the direction the whole feature takes and it deserves to
// be read as a choice rather than found as a surprise: a `-1` that reached this column out of band
// leaves the block enabled and bounding nothing. The alternative is to invent a positive number,
// and a ceiling nobody typed is a ceiling that silences an agent for real customers on the strength
// of corrupted data — the same trade the unreadable-ledger path already makes in the same
// direction, one level up. It is not silent, either: the console renders exactly what this returns,
// so an operator looking at the ceiling screen sees the zero.
//
// AND IT CLAMPS TO THE MAXIMUM THE WRITER ENFORCES, so this reader can never return a block the
// writer would refuse. That is not the two sides collapsing into one question — one still answers
// "what is stored" and the other "may this be stored" — it is the round trip between them. A value
// past the maximum can only arrive out of band (an import, a hand-edited column), and
// `updateSpendCeiling` merges THIS output with the operator's patch before validating the merge, so
// passing it through would 422 every save on the screen over a field the operator never touched,
// with nothing rendered that they could fix. Each clamp runs toward the safe side of its own field:
// a notice that speaks more often, a ceiling that is lower.
//
// The sibling blocks in `tenant-settings/service.ts` hold the same invariant by a different trade:
// they run the strict schema itself, partial, and fall back to the DEFAULTS for the whole block when
// any field fails. This one reads field by field on purpose, so one bad number does not discard an
// operator's message and ceilings along with it, and per-field clamping is what that costs.
