// Whether an HTTP tool's request will actually carry the credential attached to it. Issue #504: a
// tool can reference a `generic` credential while nothing in its templates interpolates `{{secret}}`.
// Nothing refuses that, and nothing should — a tool may legitimately hold a reference it does not
// wire yet — but the failure it produces is unreadable: the request goes out UNAUTHENTICATED and the
// upstream answers 401/403, which reads as a bad credential rather than as one that was never sent.
//
// THIS FILE IS A COPY OF `buildHttpTool`'s ASSEMBLY, AND THAT IS THE ONE THING TO KNOW ABOUT IT.
// A warning cannot run the request it is warning about — the executor resolves DNS and SSRF-guards
// the final URL before it would reach a stubbed fetch — so what the credential does has to be read
// off the row instead. Four review rounds found nine places where the copy was thinner than the
// original, every one of them confirmed by executing the real tool, and the fence in
// tests/modules/tool-credential-wiring.test.ts is that same execution: one table, read as a tool
// definition the executor runs and as the shapes a write would store, asserting the two agree.
//
// Where the copy cannot be sure, it is written to err QUIET — the legacy-fields body counts every
// fixed field as emitted, a query value that may interpolate empty counts as not shadowing, a kv row
// the model may not overwrite keeps what came before it. The intent is that a gap costs a warning
// that does not appear rather than a warning about a tool that works.
//
// THAT IS AN INTENT, NOT A PROPERTY, and it has been violated twice — both times by a fix for a gap
// in the other direction. Collapsing kv rows by key (round 4) erased a value the model's silence
// leaves in the payload; substituting a fixed query key raw (round 5) read `token&x` as two
// parameters and called the credential's own shadowed. Each new rule here is a chance to warn about
// a working tool, so a rule that CANNOT be stated in the safe direction does not belong.
//
// THE QUESTION IS NOT "does a template mention {{secret}}". It is "does the credential reach the
// request", and the two come apart in four ways the runtime decides and a text scan does not see: a
// body is only assembled for POST/PUT/PATCH, a fixed field's value only leaves if something emitted
// references it, a typed credential's auto-injection is skipped when the operator already wrote its
// target header or query param, and a stored single-brace `{secret}` is normalized at BUILD time and
// does reach. Each of those was a wrong answer in the first draft of this file, and each is fenced by
// executing the real tool rather than by a list written here.
