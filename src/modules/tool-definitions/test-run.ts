// Run an HTTP tool definition ONCE, from the editor, and hand the operator back both what the
// provider answered and what the model would have been given (issue #456).
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS. Declaring a response template means naming paths into a response, and the paths
// only exist if you have a response. Before this, the only way to get one was to save the tool,
// grant it to an agent, coax the agent into calling it and read the trace — a loop long enough that
// operators guess the paths instead, and a guessed path is exactly the silent mis-aim the picker
// was built to remove. One button closes it: the definition on screen, unsaved, against the real
// API.
//
// IT ADDS NO CAPABILITY. Whoever reaches this can already save the definition, grant it and call it
// from the playground; what changes is the length of the loop, not what the operator can make the
// server do. Which is why none of the guards are restated here — the request goes out through
// `buildHttpTool`, exactly as a turn's would, so the host allowlist, the SSRF guard, the
// no-redirect rule and the bounded timeout are the same code. A second fetch path would be a second
// place for those to age.
//
// AND IT REGISTERS NOTHING. `appointmentBooked` / `cancelAppointment` are deliberately not wired:
// testing the tool that books must not book, and must not arm reminders. `emitAck` is out for the
// same reason — there is no customer on the other end of this, and wiring the ack would also make
// `__wait_message` a required argument of a schema the operator never filled.

  // The first version of this made every throw a 400, on the reasoning that everything reachable in

  // say so: a name that does not resolve, a TLS handshake that fails, a provider that does not
  // answer inside the bound — none of those is a malformed request, and answering 400 tells the
