// What an operator-authored HTTP tool says its response should LOOK LIKE by the time it reaches the
// model, and how that is rendered off a response body. Pure: no I/O, no clock.
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS. Without it the model gets the provider's raw body, clipped at maxResponseChars.
// Measured against a public CNPJ lookup (#456): a 7,982-char response whose first 2.3k are five
// third parties' names and masked tax ids, and whose registration status sits at char 7,806 — past
// the cut. The agent then answered with a status that was not in the tool result at all, twice. A
// truncated payload does not read to a model as missing data; it reads as a gap to fill from
// training data. So the fix is not a bigger clip, it is letting the tool say which nine fields it
// wanted and handing over only those.
//
// WHY A TEMPLATE AND NOT A FIELD MAP. A map answers "which fields", and the operator still has to
// hope the model reads the resulting JSON the way they meant. A markdown block answers "which
// fields, under which names, in which order", which is the same thing the n8n formatting node this
// replaces was doing. It costs one concept: a token is a path into the response.
//
// THE TOKENS HERE ARE NOT THE TOKENS IN `graph/tools/http.ts`. That module's PLACEHOLDER is the
// REQUEST-side vocabulary — `{{contact_name}}`, `{{secret}}`, the AI-filled fields — and its grammar
// has no dots. This one addresses the RESPONSE and nothing else: no context, no credential, no model
// input. `{{secret}}` in a response template is looked up in the response body like any other path,
// finds nothing, and renders as absent. Sharing one pattern between the two would have made that
// sentence untrue, which is the same reason `documents/tokens.ts` does not share the prompt's.

// rows could not be projected at all and kept the raw clip, with the invention risk this module
// exists to remove, on exactly the tools operators write most: a product search, a slot lookup, an
// order history. A block repeats its content once per item of the list its path names:
//
//   {{#each resultados}}
//   - {{nome}} — R$ {{preco}}
//   {{/each}}
//
// Inside it a path is RELATIVE to the item, and `{{.}}` is the item itself, the one thing a list
// of strings has to address. The same spelling names the body outside a block (`{{#each .}}` walks
// a response that IS the list), so "a path is relative to the current scope, and `.` is the scope"
// stays one sentence. Blocks do not nest, deliberately: the second level is where "relative to
// which item" stops being one sentence, and no tool measured so far needed it.
//
// Both markers are well-formed tokens to TOKEN, which is why the block scan runs FIRST and the
// token scan sees only what is left: a `{{/each}}` judged as a path would be refused as malformed,
// and a `{{#each a}}` left to the token render would reach the model as literal text.

// appended while it fits under the model's clip with room left for the count of what follows, so
// the block's own items are never what pushes the count past the clip (round 1 of review: 100 rows
// of ~100 characters rendered 40 and cut the marker off with them). The remainder is never dropped
// silently either way: a model reading "and 120 more" knows to ask for a narrower query, and one
// reading a list that simply ends does not.
//
// What the budget does NOT cover is text BEFORE the block: two values at MAX_VALUE_CHARS already
// fill the clip, and then no list and no count fits after them. That is #456's per-value clip
// doing what it always did to any field after them, not something a block makes worse, and the
// clip's own backstop answers it on both sides: `…[truncated]` where the cut happened for the
