  // re-engaged a thread a person was running. Defaulting it off would mean every install keeps that
  // behaviour until an operator goes looking for a switch they have no reason to suspect exists.
  //
  // It is a switch and not a constant because "a human spoke" is not universally a handoff: a flow
