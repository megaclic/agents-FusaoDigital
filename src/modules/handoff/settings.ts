// Per-agent handoff targeting, read from `agent.settings.handoff`. Controls WHO receives the
// conversation when the `handoff_to_human` native tool fires (the summary-note behavior stays on the
// `Agent.transferWithSummary` column):
//   * "route"        → just set the conversation to open; Chatwoot's inbox routing assigns whoever
//                      (round-robin / assignment policy). Default — previous behavior, retrocompatible.
//   * "pinned"       → assign to a fixed agent OR team the operator picked (targetAgentId/targetTeamId).
//   * "agent_choice" → the model may pass a target NAME (agent or team), resolved against the live
//                      Chatwoot list at call time; the operator lists the options in the prompt.
