//                   them back); proactiveSendMode applies the 24h window/HSM template on official WhatsApp.

//                   (the website chat AND the WhatsApp sibling) and resolve both. A new widget message

// transition detection) — there only the WhatsApp side is messaged, since the chat is already being

// PENDING rows only, so a ladder the worker had already claimed runs to completion — and this
// ladder's terminal stage posts a closing message on BOTH conversations and resolves them. A /reset
// would report the episode cleared and the customer would then be said goodbye to and closed.
//
// The tombstone is the same mechanism appointment reminders use, kept local to this kind rather than
// pushed into cancelPendingJob: that primitive has eight callers across four modules, and each of
// them would need its own handler-side fence to make the change mean anything.
//
// NO arming cutoff here, unlike the appointment reminders: this ladder lives on ONE permanent row
// per widget thread, so "created before the command" is true of every ladder that exists and a
// re-arm does not move it. A cutoff on it would buy nothing and could only fail in the direction
// that leaves a claimed closing running — the one that messages and resolves both conversations.
//
// DONE even for a row the worker is holding, and that pairs with the bump rather than duplicating it.
// Bumping alone leaves a CLAIMED row nobody can finish — the in-flight worker's complete, reschedule
// and fail all CAS on the old token and no-op, while no claim can pick it up again because it is
// still CLAIMED — so it sits wedged until the stale-job sweep records a failure that never happened.
// Terminal here, superseded there: the handler's writes land on nothing and the row is already
// finished.
//
// The claim token is bumped with it, and that is what makes the fence hold at the LAST boundary the
// handler does not own: its return value. `completeJob`/`rescheduleJob`/`failJob` all CAS on the
// token the claim handed out (issue #164), so a stamp landing after the handler's final read still
// wins — the reschedule writes nothing instead of replacing the payload and re-arming the stage the
// stamp was meant to stop. The mechanism already existed for exactly this sentence: "a run that was
// superseded while it worked writes nothing".
//
// A re-arm replaces the payload wholesale (enqueueJob's upsert is authoritative), so a lead who
// replies in the chat clears the stamp along with the rest of the old payload.
