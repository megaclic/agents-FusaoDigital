// is a cost with no reader — and it is the shape the rest of the product already reads: labels are
// what the team filters by, what the reports count and what the automations key off.
//
// THE TICK IS STATELESS. It reads the newest messages of the conversation from Chatwoot rather than
// the agent's memory thread, for two reasons that both come from the thread being keyed by CONTACT-
// INBOX and not by agent: an observer beside a responder shares that thread (and would read the
// responder's summaries as its own), and a conversation that predates the observer has history the
// thread never saw. Chatwoot has all of it, and a transcription written by anyone is read through the
// same renderers the turn uses.
//
// ONE model call, constrained to a schema DERIVED from the label groups, and the verdict is applied
// deterministically (./apply.ts): the model names a value per group, the code decides the set. It
// never touches a label outside its groups, never writes a value the group does not list, and never
// writes at all when nothing changed. A change is announced as a PRIVATE note on the conversation,
// so the person answering it sees why the label moved without opening the console; nothing here has
// a customer-facing channel.

  // holds the snapshot read at load time. On an `on_resolve` agent that message arms nothing by

  // `completeJob` CASes on it — but that CAS happens AFTER the handler returns, so the labels and
  // the private note have already landed. The note is what makes this worth a read: a label a later
  // tick repairs, a note is permanent, and so is anything a label-triggered automation did. Standing
  // down cannot livelock, because standing down IS the successor being there: the row that
