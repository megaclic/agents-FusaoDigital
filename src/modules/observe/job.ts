// The OBSERVE job (issue #477): a monitoring agent's verdict on a conversation it does not answer,
// written as labels. It is what a watcher is for — a memory that grows and is never asked anything
// is a cost with no reader — and it is the shape the rest of the product already reads: labels are
// what the team filters by, what the reports count and what the automations key off.
//
// THE TICK IS STATELESS. It reads the newest messages of the conversation from Chatwoot rather than
// the agent's memory thread, for two reasons that both come from the thread being keyed by CONTACT-
// INBOX and not by agent: an observer beside a responder shares that thread (and would read the
// responder's summaries as its own), and a conversation that predates the observer has history the
// thread never saw. Chatwoot has all of it, and a transcription written by anyone is read through the
// same renderers the turn uses.
//
// THEN THE ORDINARY TURN, on a muted client: `buildToolset` and `buildModelAndGraph`, the same two
// calls the reactive turn and the nudge make. What the watcher does with what it read is its prompt
// and its tools, not this file's business — this file only guarantees that nothing it does can
// reach the customer, and that it stops when the world moves under it. It used to be one model call
// constrained to a schema derived from `settings.monitoring.labelGroups`, with the verdict applied
// deterministically here and announced as a private note; issue #568 is that whole shape.

// every other tenant's scheduled work, and discovery happens before any model call.
//
// Raised from the 60s the single constrained verdict call used to get, because a turn is now as many
// model calls as the model makes tool calls, and a deadline a legitimate turn cannot meet is a tick
