  // The spend ceiling, again, at the point the TURN happens, and for the reason the gate below is

  // apart, and the tenant can cross its ceiling inside that window — from its own other
  // conversations, or from this one's earlier burst. The webhook's ask covered the arming; this one
  // covers the turn, which is the thing that actually spends.
  //
  // The burst is dropped the way a refused contact drops it: the watermark advances off the payload's
  // own last id, nothing is answered, and the flow line is what tells the operator. Where it goes
  // further is that this refusal is the FIRST one. A contact refused here was already told and
  // handed off by the webhook delivery that was refused; a ceiling crossed inside the debounce
  // window never refused anything, so this flush owes the whole contract — the operator's sentence
  // to the customer, the handoff, and the note — under the same cooldown key the webhook gate uses.
  //
  // None of it can be left to the customer's next message. With `handoffEnabled` (the default) the
  // open is precisely what takes the conversation out of `pending`, so `shouldBotHandle` is false
  // from then on and no later message of theirs reaches a gate at all; with the handoff off the
  // conversation stays `pending`, but the burst being dropped here would go unanswered in silence
  // unless the customer happened to write a second time.
  // NOTHING LEFT TO ANSWER ⇒ NOTHING TO REFUSE, asked before the ceiling rather than after it. A
  // claimed job can be retried after an earlier attempt already advanced the watermark past this
  // payload's own last id — the attempt answered the burst and died before the scheduler could mark
  // the job done. Over the ceiling, the retry would then tell the customer the agent cannot answer,
  // hand the conversation off and write a refusal, all about a burst that was answered. Read off
  // the payload and the watermark this flush already holds, so it costs nothing; a payload with no
  // last id cannot say, and falls through to ask exactly as before.
  // THE BURST SELECTOR, hoisted: the ceiling branch below asks the same question the turn does, and
  // it has to be the same closure or the two would answer about different floors.
  //
  // Re-read, not the value captured before the authorization call: that call is a round-trip to
  // somebody else's endpoint with a ceiling of ten seconds, and a message that arrived and was
  // REFUSED inside that window has already had the watermark advanced past it by its own delivery.
  // Against the stale value it would be selected here and handed to the model, and the post gate
