// FLOOR that depends on where the handled watermark stands (round 18). Still below the armed burst,
// the watermark is the floor: everything under it was handled — answered, observed, or deliberately
// skipped — and the burst is exactly what sits above it. Past the burst, it says nothing about the
// burst any more: an observed message that arrived after the flip moved it, and the burst under it
// was never folded in. Then the floor is the LAST REPLY, which is the one mark no observed message
// moves. Ingestion is idempotent by message id (../../graph/ingest.ts), so a message already folded
// costs a skip. Reading above the watermark where it applies is not only cheaper: a reply a hundred
// messages back — or none, for an agent that observed before it answered — would send the walk to
// its bound with the whole burst already in hand, and leave it unmarked for a later flush to answer
// a second time. The watermark moves only past what was actually read: a burst the walk could not
// bring into view stays unmarked (round 7), and the flush fails so the loss is visible (round 25):
// the ordinary flush reads one page and would advance the watermark past what the bound left out.
// Chatwoot's page size for a conversation's messages, and how far back the observed-burst read
// walks before it gives up on finding the floor: five pages is a hundred messages, well past any

// backoff and, past the cap, dead-letters it where an operator sees it. "unread" — a bound reached,
// no thread — is permanent and stays a completed job, logged. A read of the AGENT that failed is
// "failed" too (round 20): collapsed into "not observing", it would have the exit mark the burst

  // conversations, or from this one's earlier burst. The webhook's ask covered the arming; this one
  // covers the turn, which is the thing that actually spends.
  //
  // The burst is dropped the way a refused contact drops it: the watermark advances off the payload's
  // own last id, nothing is answered, and the flow line is what tells the operator. Where it goes
  // further is that this refusal is the FIRST one. A contact refused here was already told and
  // handed off by the webhook delivery that was refused; a ceiling crossed inside the debounce
  // window never refused anything, so this flush owes the whole contract — the operator's sentence
  // to the customer, the handoff, and the note — under the same cooldown key the webhook gate uses.
  //
  // None of it can be left to the customer's next message. With `handoffEnabled` (the default) the
  // open is precisely what takes the conversation out of `pending`, so `shouldBotHandle` is false
  // from then on and no later message of theirs reaches a gate at all; with the handoff off the
  // conversation stays `pending`, but the burst being dropped here would go unanswered in silence
  // unless the customer happened to write a second time.
  // NOTHING LEFT TO ANSWER ⇒ NOTHING TO REFUSE, asked before the ceiling rather than after it. A
  // claimed job can be retried after an earlier attempt already advanced the watermark past this
  // payload's own last id — the attempt answered the burst and died before the scheduler could mark
  // the job done. Over the ceiling, the retry would then tell the customer the agent cannot answer,
  // hand the conversation off and write a refusal, all about a burst that was answered. Read off
  // the payload and the watermark this flush already holds, so it costs nothing; a payload with no
  // last id cannot say, and falls through to ask exactly as before.
  // THE BURST SELECTOR, hoisted: the ceiling branch below asks the same question the turn does, and
  // it has to be the same closure or the two would answer about different floors.
  //
  // Re-read, not the value captured before the authorization call: that call is a round-trip to
  // somebody else's endpoint with a ceiling of ten seconds, and a message that arrived and was
  // REFUSED inside that window has already had the watermark advanced past it by its own delivery.
  // Against the stale value it would be selected here and handed to the model, and the post gate
  // would only withhold the reply — after the tools had run. The floor is the one this flush read at
  // claim time, so a watermark that somehow reads lower cannot widen the burst.
  //
  // And it is the ANSWERED floor rather than the watermark, because the two can disagree: the reply
  // claim is written before the send and the watermark after the turn, so a reply whose watermark
  // write was lost leaves the message answered with the mark behind it (issue #452).
