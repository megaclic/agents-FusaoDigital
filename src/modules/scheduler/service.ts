// A claim carries a TOKEN (`claimSeq`), and the three writes that finish a job CAS on it. The reason
// is that a row is re-armed IN PLACE: `enqueueJob` upserts the same physical row back to PENDING, so
// "the row is CLAIMED" never distinguished the run holding the claim from a later one. Guarded on
// status alone, a handler that finished late marked whatever arm existed DONE, and the work that arm
// stood for was never done by anyone (issue #164).
//
// The bump lives on the CLAIM and nowhere else, which is enough for both orderings and is why
// `enqueueJob` does not touch it. A re-arm that is not claimed again leaves the row PENDING, and the
// old CAS already refuses that; a re-arm that IS claimed again bumps past the token the first run
// holds. Adding a second bump on the re-arm would buy nothing and put a write on a hot path.
//
// The CLAIM is cross-tenant —
// it must see every tenant's due jobs — so it runs via asSuperAdmin with FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED;
// the GUC is transaction-local (set_config(...,true)) so it never leaks to the next request on a
// pooled connection. Each job's EFFECT and status update run under the job's OWN tenant scope
// (runScoped), so RLS still fences the work. `attempts` grows only on failure/crash and is CLEARED
// by a completed pass, whichever way it ends: rescheduleJob (issue #287) and completeJob (#339). So
// the cap bounds CONSECUTIVE failures rather than the row's lifetime; the reaper bounds crash loops
// by pushing exhausted jobs to DEAD. What a completed pass cannot reach is a row whose LAST pass
// failed, and there the budget outlives the work only if the next arm says it should: see `Rearm`.

// of healthy passes and dead-letters on the fifth, permanently and silently.

// It does NOT hand a broken unit of work an unbounded retry, and the reason is the shape of a

// pass, so a genuinely failing FOLLOWUP step or MEMORY_COMPACT still burns its five and dies. What
// this does exempt is a job that fails INTERMITTENTLY, which is a job that works, and one that
// dies for good in silence is the worse of the two outcomes. completeJob clears it for the same
