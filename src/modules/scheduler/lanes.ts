// Which drain each job kind belongs to, and the rule for when a new drain is warranted.
//
// THE RULE: a lane is justified by CADENCE or by BUDGET. Never by duration.
//
// Duration was the reason this file exists, and it is the reason that no longer applies. The shared
// tick used to drain its batch one job at a time, so a slow kind delayed every kind claimed with it,
// and the only escape was a lane of one's own — which is how a design with two special cases and one
// queue holding everything else grew, one lane at a time, with nothing saying when the next was due
// (issue #165). The shared tick now drains concurrently, like the other two always have, so a slow
// job no longer delays anything. A kind that is merely slow needs no lane.
//
// What still justifies one:
//
//   CADENCE — the kind's latency is felt at a different timescale than the shared tick's. DEBOUNCE
//   is the case: a flush waiting up to a full scheduler interval is a customer watching a reply not
//   arrive, so it gets a fast tick of its own. Concurrency does not help here; the wait is until the
//   next tick, not behind another job.
//
//   BUDGET — the kind must be capped against a resource the shared lane does not cap. MEMORY_COMPACT
//   is the case: it fires for every agent on every closed attendance and takes permits from the same
//   model semaphore a customer's turn queues on, so its lane sizes its batch to a quarter of that
//   budget. Concurrency does not help here either; it is the opposite of what is wanted.
//
// So the question for an eleventh kind is not "is it slow" but "does it need a different tick rate,
// or a cap of its own". If neither, it belongs here, and the compiler will ask: this map is exhaustive
// over SchedulerJobKind, so a kind added to the enum does not compile until it is placed.

  TAKEOVER_RECOVERY: "shared",
  // Shared, and neither reason applies. Cadence: what it writes is a label on a conversation a person
  // is answering, and a label that lands one shared tick after the burst it describes is not a

  // the cap it wants — the same pool a customer's turn queues on, so a busy inbox's observers cannot

  // before it — and ingestion's own tick latency explicitly does not matter (a turn drains its
  // thread before reading), while a recovery's does. FIFO bounds it — a recovery only ever waits for
  // work older than itself — and past `MAX_RECOVERY_AGE_MS` the recovery is discarded, which is the
  // right answer for a different reason: a reply that late is stale whatever delayed it. Reserving
  // capacity here would be mechanism for a backlog nobody has measured.

  // was carrying a colleague's reply when the process died. Fewer than of the kind above — most

  // the number follows inbound traffic rather than a population the install controls.
  //
  // The cost paragraph above does NOT carry over, and the difference is worth naming: this kind has

  // the same batch as an appointment reminder. OBSERVE is on `shared`, and there it is the only kind
  // whose row count follows how much contacts write: every other one is per agent, per appointment,
  // per closed attendance, per tenant, per retry. A resolve arms for `now` and a burst for `now`
  // plus a window measured in seconds, so within a tick or two they are as old as anything else in
  // the lane, and a claim ordered by `run_at` fills the batch with them. On an inbox under
