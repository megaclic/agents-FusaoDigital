// Which drain each job kind belongs to, and the rule for when a new drain is warranted.
//
// THE RULE: a lane is justified by CADENCE or by BUDGET. Never by duration.
//
// Duration was the reason this file exists, and it is the reason that no longer applies. The shared
// tick used to drain its batch one job at a time, so a slow kind delayed every kind claimed with it,
// and the only escape was a lane of one's own — which is how a design with two special cases and one
// queue holding everything else grew, one lane at a time, with nothing saying when the next was due
// (issue #165). The shared tick now drains concurrently, like the other two always have, so a slow
// job no longer delays anything. A kind that is merely slow needs no lane.
//
// What still justifies one:
//
//   CADENCE — the kind's latency is felt at a different timescale than the shared tick's. DEBOUNCE
//   is the case: a flush waiting up to a full scheduler interval is a customer watching a reply not
//   arrive, so it gets a fast tick of its own. Concurrency does not help here; the wait is until the
//   next tick, not behind another job.
//
//   BUDGET — the kind must be capped against a resource the shared lane does not cap. MEMORY_COMPACT
//   is the case: it fires for every agent on every closed attendance and takes permits from the same
//   model semaphore a customer's turn queues on, so its lane sizes its batch to a quarter of that
//   budget. Concurrency does not help here either; it is the opposite of what is wanted.
//
// So the question for an eleventh kind is not "is it slow" but "does it need a different tick rate,
// or a cap of its own". If neither, it belongs here, and the compiler will ask: this map is exhaustive
// over SchedulerJobKind, so a kind added to the enum does not compile until it is placed.

  // hoping the tick got there first. With the barrier the cadence stops mattering, and the fast tick
  // turns into a liability: the debounce worker can be switched off (DEBOUNCE_WORKER_ENABLED), and
  // a kind parked in that lane would then never drain at all, silently, on an install that simply
  // does not use debounce.

// drains it, this says how many may run at once inside that tick, and a single flag answering both
// would be wrong exactly where they diverge (issue #180 review).
//
// It exists because making the shared drain concurrent created a BUDGET problem inside a lane —
// twenty due follow-ups start twenty nudges, and with the default AGENT_MODEL_CONCURRENCY they can
// hold every permit in the process-wide model semaphore while a customer's reply waits behind a
// proactive one. The serial drain took at most one permit; that was its one virtue.
//
// RAG_INGEST is here for a different provider and a sharper reason: `embedTexts` does not go through
// that semaphore at all, so nothing else bounds it. Twenty documents due at once (a bulk import, a
// reindex) meant twenty embedding batches in flight, provider rate limits, and documents landing in
// FAILED for no reason a reader could see.
//
// A kind NOT listed here is bounded only by the batch size, which is the point: HEARTBEAT and the
// sweeps do a query and finish, and making them queue behind a nudge is the head-of-line blocking
// this lane just stopped doing.

// Whether the NUMBER of rows of this kind follows inbound traffic, rather than a population the
// install controls. A third question about a kind, and the reason it is not the lane's: everything
// here shares one tick, and one FIFO batch of a fixed size.
//
// Every other kind is bounded by something that does not scale with how much a contact writes — one
// per agent, per appointment, per closed attendance, per retry. INGEST_MESSAGE is one per MESSAGE the
// agent did not answer, so a busy fleet can arm more of them per tick than the batch can hold. Being
// armed for `now`, they are also the oldest rows, so a claim ordered by run_at fills every batch with
// them and never reaches an appointment reminder — a kind that exists to arrive BEFORE something —
// no matter how long it waits.
//
// The answer is not a lane of its own. Ingestion's tick latency does not matter at all: every reader
// of a memory thread drains it before reading (../../graph/ingest-drain.ts), so the tick is a
// backstop for threads nobody touches, and a lane would only add a worker flag that an install can
// leave off. What it needs is a CAP — the shared tick claims these separately, with a share of the
// batch, so the fixed-rate kinds always have the rest.
