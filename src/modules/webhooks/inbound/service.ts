  // driver that re-runs a delivery (`processInboundDelivery` is called only by the inbound route,
  // detached, and we ack 200 before Phase B, so no provider redelivers), and the conversion barrier
  // means a redelivery that did arrive would take the `done` path instead of re-running the nudge.
