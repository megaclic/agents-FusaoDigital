// Merge a patch into a stored block key by key, at ANY depth (issue #184). Two objects merge;
// anything else replaces.
//
// The depth is the whole point. One shallow spread kept the "untouched keys preserved" promise at
// the top level of a block and broke it one step in, and the break was silent rather than loud:
// each block is re-read through its typed reader afterwards, so a sub-object the patch replaced
// came back FILLED WITH DEFAULTS instead of absent. Turning off a guardrail direction returned a
// complete, plausible direction with the operator's refusal text swapped for the product's and
// `action: "silent"` — send nothing — swapped for `template` — send this.
//
// An ARRAY replaces, deliberately: a list patch means the new list. Merging element by element
// would make a shorter `followUp.steps` or a smaller attribute scope impossible to express, which
// is the opposite of what sending one means.
// How deep the merge will follow a patch before it stops descending and simply replaces. Both halves
// of that are load-bearing.
//
// It is BOUNDED because the settings bag is caller-supplied on both sides — the stored value and the
// patch — and `agentUpdateSchema.settings` accepts arbitrary nested `unknown`. Recursing once per
// level turns "store a deep object, then patch it" into `RangeError: Maximum call stack size
// exceeded` (measured against this tree: 5_000 levels merge fine, 20_000 throw), and since the throw
// escapes the write, the agent's settings would stay unwritable until the row was repaired by hand.
//
// The number comes from the shape the readers actually produce, not from the stack: the deepest is
// `guardrails.input.checks.toxicity`, at 4. Eight is double that and four orders of magnitude short
// of where the stack gives out. `mergeMaxDepthCoversReaders` in the tests ties the two together, so
// a block that grows deeper than this fails there rather than silently losing values past the cap.
//
// Past the cap it REPLACES, which is what the merge did at every level before it learned to descend.
// Nothing that used to work changes shape; only the runaway stops.
