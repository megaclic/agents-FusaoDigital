// attempts," reads as a complete rule everywhere the operator can look.
//
// So the readers keep clamping (defense for what is already stored), the write boundary refuses the
// text a write INTRODUCES or CHANGES (`assertSettingsTextSizes`, so nobody loses text without being
// told, and see collectOversizedTextChanges for why it has to be only that), the importer clamps and
// warns (a bundle authored elsewhere should not be rejected whole, but the operator hears about it),
// and the editor declares the cap on the field itself.
//
// Deliberately NOT here: the list-shaped caps (guardrails competitors, follow-up labels, appointment
// reminder offsets). Those bound how MANY entries are kept, and an entry that gets dropped is visible
// as a missing row rather than as a sentence that ends early.
