// How bad each configuration warning is, for a caller that has to DECIDE something with it. The

// and "is this agent healthy" is not a yes/no — it finishes with a list, and the only useful next
// question is whether to stop or to note it and carry on.
//
// The three levels are not a scale of annoyance. Each answers a different question about what the
// customer experiences RIGHT NOW, and every key below is placed by the consequence its own block in
// config-health.ts already names, never by how alarming the sentence sounds:
//
//   blocking   The agent does not answer, or it answers without a protection whose switch reads
//              "on". Nothing else about the install matters while one of these is live.
//   degraded   The agent answers. A feature the operator turned on does not run, silently, so the
//              install delivers less than it was configured to.
//   advisory   Nothing is off. Two settings contradict each other, or text already stored is longer
//              than its reader keeps. The operator picks; there is no wrong state to repair.
