// A condition an operator declares on ONE granted tool, checked by the runtime at the moment the
// model calls it: unmet, and the call does not run. It is the enforceable half of `toolGuidance`
// (tool-guidance.ts): guidance says WHEN to use a tool and is re-decided by the model every turn;
// a precondition says when the tool MAY be used, and is not the model's to re-decide.
//
// Measured motivation (issue #101): an agent told, in five separate places, never to hand off
// without the article URL called `handoff_to_human` on three consecutive runs of the same input and
// wrote the unmet condition into its own `reason` argument each time. The prompt was not the defect;
// the absence of an enforcement point was.
//
// TYPED, and deliberately not an expression language. The market splits here: OPA/Rego and Cedar are
// expression languages because their audience writes code, while the operator-facing products
// (Copilot Studio) give conditions over a NAMED VARIABLE and no syntax at all. This surface is
// configured by the same operator who types the prompt, so it is data. It is also the direction that
// stays open: a closed set of conditions translates mechanically into an expression later, while an
// expression published to operators is a contract that cannot be taken back.

// [code-tool] This type is the STATE NAMESPACE — the one piece a future sandboxed code tool
// genuinely shares with this file, because "what can a rule see about the conversation" is the same
// question for both and it is the expensive half to get right. When that tool lands, reconcile HERE
// rather than growing a second vocabulary: a rule that reads `conversationAttributes` in one place
// and `conversation.attributes` in another is a migration of operator configuration later.
// What must NOT be shared is the LANGUAGE. Code-tool code is authored by the MODEL, per turn, and
// may loop, call out and fail; a precondition is authored by the OPERATOR, once, and has to always
// terminate and always answer, because its answer decides whether a call happens at all. Letting the
// model author the rule that binds the model is the failure mode issue #363 measured one layer down.

// (dropDuplicateToolNames), so a name is the one identifier every source already agrees on.
//
// A malformed condition is DROPPED, not repaired: a precondition that "sort of" parses is worse than
// none, because the operator would read the tool as guarded while the runtime treats it as open. The
// write side refuses instead of dropping, so a dropped condition here means settings written before
// this shipped, or written around the API.

// The NAME is not filtered here, only at the write boundary (isGuardableToolName). An agent import
// copies a settings bag verbatim, so a rule on a non-native name can arrive without passing that
// boundary, and the honest thing for the runtime to do with it is to guard the tool if the name
// still matches one. When it matches nothing the seam says so (prepare.ts) rather than leaving the
// operator to read an inert rule as protection.
// NULL-PROTOTYPE, and both directions of that bit. A tool name is operator text: `__proto__` as a
// key on a plain object mutates the prototype instead of storing a rule, so the guard the operator
// wrote simply disappears; and a tool named `constructor` or `toString` finds an INHERITED value on
// lookup, so an unguarded tool is blocked by something nobody configured.

// WHICH NAMES MAY CARRY A RULE, and the answer is the native catalog — not "any tool name".
//
// The runtime applies a condition to whatever exposed name matches, at the one seam where all six
// sources meet, and that stays true. What is refused here is WRITING a rule on a name whose exposed
// form is not stable identity, because a precondition that follows a name onto a different tool, or
// stops matching entirely, is a guard that silently stops guarding — the single failure this feature
// must not have.
//
// Measured, per source:
//   - NATIVE: the name IS the identity. `handoff_to_human` is not renameable, not namespaced, and
//     `dropDuplicateToolNames` puts natives first, so no other source can take the name from one.
//   - HTTP: `ToolDefinition.name` is normalized on write and `@@unique([tenantId, name])`. Stable
//     today, but a rename is a plain PATCH away and nothing would carry the rule across it.
//   - MCP: `mcp__<slug>__<tool>`, where the slug is derived from the connection's display name —
//     including the fallback for a name that yields no ASCII at all (emoji-only, CJK-only), which is
//     a digest of the name and no longer the connection id (#412). A `_2` suffix on two
//     slug-colliding connections is decided by grant order, which is anchored on the connection's
//     name. So the name survives a re-save (#389) and an export/import (#412) — and still moves
//     under a RENAME of the connection, which nothing carries the rule across.
//   - INTEGRATION: two instances of one catalog type expose the SAME names; the later is dropped,
//     and which one survives is again grant order, anchored on (catalogType, name) — so it too
//     survives a transfer and moves under a rename.
//
// So the extension past native waits on a name a rename cannot move, which is its own change to how
// MCP and toolpack tools are namespaced. The console offers exactly this set for the same
// reason (ToolPreconditionsEditor), and docs/graph.md carries the boundary.
//
// This is the repo's existing shape for a settings bag keyed by tool name, not a new one:
// `toolGuidance` is restricted to the same catalog in both of its readers (readToolGuidance drops a
// non-native key, and text-caps.ts only caps the native ones, saying "an unknown one is text nothing
// ever reads"). What differs is the POLICY, and deliberately: guidance DROPS an unusable key
// silently, this REFUSES it at the write. A lost hint is a hint; a lost guard reads on screen as
// protection that is not there.
