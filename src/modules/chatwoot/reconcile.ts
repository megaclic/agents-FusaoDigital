// Applies a LIVE conversation snapshot (a REST `GET /conversations/:id`) to the mirror row, under the
// same ordering rule the webhook mirror uses.
//
// Two callers, one reason. A GET is the only way to learn the conversation's own version
// (`updated_at.to_f`) outside a webhook: the write endpoints render an agent or a status blob and
// never that field, while `api/v1/conversations/partials/_conversation.json.jbuilder` renders exactly
// the value the webhook carries. So whoever acts on Chatwoot over REST and then writes this row has
// to read the conversation back, or the row keeps a mark describing the state BEFORE the action, and
// an event that was already in flight — carrying a higher version and the pre-action truth — is
// accepted over it.
//
//   * the proactive nudge, which probes live ownership before spending on a model, and
//   * the console's handoff / return / status buttons (issue #77), whose write is otherwise
//     unversioned and can be undone by a conversation event Chatwoot was still retrying.
//
// The write is conditional in three independent ways, which is what keeps this safe to call after
// any REST action: a webhook committed between the GET and here is newer (the lastEventAt fence), a
// field is only written when the version carrying it is at least as new as the mark that orders that
// field, and each mark only ever moves forward. Nothing is written when nothing differs.

// What the reconcile did, for a caller that has to act on it. The nudge only needs the write to have
// happened; the console needs both halves of this:
//
//   * `state` is the row AFTER the call, so an optimistic broadcast announces what is stored rather
//     than what the click intended — the two differ whenever the snapshot lost, or whenever Chatwoot
//     answered with something other than what was asked for. It carries `lastEventAt` for the same
//     reason as the rest: the snapshot can bring a message the mirror had not seen, this call
//     advances the stored recency, and the conversations list SORTS by the value it is handed;
//   * `outrankedByVersion` says WHY a field did not land. Losing to a stored VERSION is evidence that
//     something strictly newer is in the row, and the caller must leave it alone. Losing to the coarse
//     activity comparison is not evidence of anything (see the fence note below), so a caller that
//     just wrote to Chatwoot and knows what it asked for may still apply its own fields.
