// DOES THE RESPONDER ACTUALLY HAVE A DELIVERY OF THIS MESSAGE? (issue #476 review, round 31.)
//
// An observer beside a responder does not fold the message into memory, because the responder's own
// delivery of the same message does — see `responderRemembers`. That is true only when Chatwoot
// FANNED the message to the responder, and Chatwoot picks a message's recipients from the bindings
// that stand when it emits the event. A responder bound after the emission gets no delivery for it,
// so standing down there omits the message from memory permanently: nothing scans a settled
// observer row again, and the responder's route never saw it.
//
// Three answers, cheapest first, and the two reads happen only in the window that needs them:
//
//  1. The binding is older than our receipt of this delivery. Then it stood when Chatwoot emitted,
//     because emission precedes receipt. Covered, with no read. A NULL `responderBoundAt` — a
//     binding made before the column existed — is read the same way, which is exactly the behaviour
//     every such inbox already had.
//  2. The binding is newer than our receipt, and a sibling delivery on the responder's route is
//     already in the ledger for this message, AND that sibling did not already run without the
//     binding. Chatwoot fanned it after all (the two routes race, and this one lost), so it is
//     covered — direct evidence, not an inference from clocks.
//  3. The binding is newer and there is no sibling, or the only sibling already ran blind. Nothing
//     is coming. NOT covered: the observer keeps the message.
//
// THE SIBLING'S OWN CLOCK is what makes (2) evidence rather than another inference (issue #476
// review, round 32). `bindInbox` calls Chatwoot BEFORE it commits `agentId`, so a message arriving
// inside that window is fanned to a responder route the local mirror does not know yet: that
// delivery resolves no runtime, answers nothing, remembers nothing, and settles. Counting it here
// hands the message to a route that already declined it, and neither route answers or remembers —
// the limbo this whole check exists to prevent, at P1 instead of P2. So the sibling counts only
// while it can still see the binding: never claimed (`claimedAt` null — it runs after this, and the
// binding is committed by then), or claimed at or after the moment the binding was made. A sibling
// claimed BEFORE that ran blind and covers nothing.
//
// HOW FAR THE BINDING HAS TO PREDATE THE EVENT for the clocks alone to settle it (issue #476 review,
// round 45). `responderBoundAt` is stamped by US and `last_activity_at` is stamped by CHATWOOT, on a
// host whose clock is its own: compared directly, a Chatwoot running ahead makes a binding that came
// AFTER the event look older than it, and the observer stands down for a sibling that does not
// exist. No timestamp available here is a lower bound on the emission in our own clock — the receipt
// is later still — so the only clock-free evidence is the sibling row itself.
//
// A margin is what makes the fast path honest rather than removing it: outside this band the answer
// does not depend on which host is ahead, and inside it the ledger is asked instead. Five minutes is
// far past the skew a synchronised fleet produces and still covers a host that drifted without NTP;
// it costs one extra read only for a binding made around the time of the event, which is exactly the
// window the check exists for.

// delivery waited — so a binding made anywhere in that stretch read as covering a message it never
// reached. The payload's own `last_activity_at` is that moment for a `message_created` (the
// conversation's activity IS this message), and it is read at the START of its second: it is only
// ever epoch seconds, and rounding early is the direction that errs toward asking for evidence
// rather than toward assuming coverage. A payload that carries none falls back to the receipt,
// which is the reading every delivery had before this.
//
// What remains is bounded by the sibling check rather than by a clock: erring toward "the binding is
// newer" costs a duplicate line in the shared thread when the sibling is genuinely still in flight,
// and erring the other way costs the message. Wrong and visible over quiet and wrong, the rule this

// runtime that reads this delivery is the observer's — its switch, its settings, its memory — and
// the reply path is nobody's on this route, whatever `Inbox.agentId` says: the responder, if there
// is one, has its own delivery of the same event on its own route.
//
// WHAT MAKES A ROUTE AN OBSERVER'S is first of all the delivery itself: the fork delivers to a
// bot's route only because that bot is the inbox's responder or one of its observers, so a
// delivery on a route whose agent is NOT the inbox's responder was attached as an observer, row
// or no row. The row (`InboxObserver`) is written only once Chatwoot agreed (`observeInbox`), so
// the fork's first events can arrive before it, and an attach whose answer was lost never writes
// it at all. Reading the route from the delivery closes both without a second state for the row.
// What the row still decides is the agent that is NOT in monitoring: a monitoring agent on a
// route that is not the responder's is an observer by construction (only a monitoring agent can
// be attached as one); a production agent with a row is an observer whose promotion slipped into
// the attach window, and its route still answers nothing; a production agent with no row on an
// inbox it does not answer is a mirror that drifted from Chatwoot, and that route keeps the
// responder path it had before this issue.
//
// Two reads, on the same path as `inboxAgentRuntime` for every message. Null when the route is the
// responder's own, or drifted as above.
// THE ROUTE'S AGENT AS A CLASSIFIER, which is a different question from the one above (issue #477
// review, round 4). `observerRuntimeForRoute` answers "whose REPLY PATH is this route": when the
// route's own bot still HOLDS the conversation and the inbox has a responder, it deliberately
// answers null, because the reply is the responder's and reading it as an observer's would leave
// the customer unanswered. Observation is not a reply path. An agent bound to the inbox as an
// observer watches every conversation on it, including the ones its bot happens to hold from a
// life before the rebind — and hung off the reply-route answer it watched none of them, on the
// burst and on the final verdict alike.
//
// So this asks the BINDING and nothing else: a row in `InboxObserver` for this route's agent on
// this inbox. No assignee, no mode inference, no attach window — a row is the one signal that is

  // conversations — the population the whole feature exists for.
  // WHAT gets folded in, and AS WHOM. Two disjoint cases:
  //
  //  - a customer incoming message the bot will NOT answer: silenced by a gate (act && consumed —
  //    out of hours, or a contact the authorization gate refused) or not bot-handled (!act — a
  //    human owns it, or it is not pending). An answered/debounced message is covered by its own
  //    turn and is NOT re-ingested here. A refusal ingests for the same reason out-of-hours does,
  //    and it is what makes the unlock flow read as one conversation: when the code finally lands
  //    and the turn runs, the agent sees what the customer said while it was refused, instead of
  //    answering a code out of nowhere.
  //  - a HUMAN agent's reply to the customer, whatever the gate decided. No turn ever covers one:
  //    the bot did not write it. On the most ordinary shape of a real deployment — the agent
  //    qualifies a lead, a human takes over, the human closes the sale — this is the entire business
  //    half of the attendance, and without it the memory of that attendance is a conversation in
  //    which only the customer spoke (issue #187). BOTH routes a person can answer by: the Chatwoot
  //    composer, and the phone paired to the number the inbox is connected to (issue #430) — the
  //    second was the half #187 could not see, because the fork stores a device reply sender-less.
  //  - THE SAME CUSTOMER MESSAGE, arriving a second time as the update that finally carries its
  //    media (issue #478). Some transports emit `message_created` with no attachment and hang the
  //    voice note on a `message_updated` a moment later: the creation renders to nothing (no text,
  //    no attachment) and appends nothing, and the update — analysed by the eager pass a few lines
  //    up, which stashes the transcription ON `n` — was refused here for not being a creation. The
  //    provider was paid for a transcription that reached no memory at all.
  //
  //    TAKEN FROM THE ATTACHMENT TOO, not only from the event: `n.message.transcribedText` is set
  //    by the eager pass alone, so it is there on the delivery that transcribed — but the fork also
  //    re-fires the update once our write-back lands, and that second event carries the words in the
  //    attachment while the message field is still null. Reading both means the words reach memory
  //    on whichever of the two arrives, including the case where the first one's arm failed.
  //
  //    NOT PROTECTED BY THE DEDUP WINDOW, and that is why the gate below is the same one the
  //    creation used rather than something looser: the window is written by the ingest job alone, so
  //    a message a TURN answered is absent from it and a second append would stack a duplicate the
  //    dedup cannot see. What makes that safe is that an answered message needs nothing from here —
  //    the turn reads the conversation live from Chatwoot when it runs, so it sees the transcription
  //    by its own route. The gap this closes is the message no turn ever covered.
  //    AUDIO ONLY, for the reason `hasPendingInboundMediaUpdate` gives: the fork does not serialize
  //    the vision write-back into webhook payloads, so an image's description exists here only on the
  //    delivery that produced it — which is a creation, already covered by the clause above. A visual

    // FIRST among the mutations, and the ordering is the whole fence. Two races pull in opposite
    // directions and only this position settles both.
    //
    // Late is wrong because /reset is not atomic with the conversation: a message arriving during the
    // cleanup runs a turn that can book, reschedule, or re-enter the funnel, and a retirement running
    // after it kills work that belongs to the NEXT episode. Sparing that work by age does not
    // discriminate — enqueueJob re-arms by upsert, so `created_at` stays put and `updated_at` moves on
    // a claim (see cancelThreadAppointments). Retiring first needs no such test: the upsert
    // that re-arms writes `status: PENDING` with a fresh payload, so anything armed afterwards revives
    // its own row.
    //
    // Early is also what the watermarks need. Clearing the anchors first opens a gap in which a ladder
    // the worker has ALREADY claimed still passes its own fence — nothing has stamped it yet — and
    // runs to its closing, which re-sets `redirectClosedAt` on the row the command just cleared, on a
    // conversation it also resolves. With the stamp landing here, anything in flight stands down, and
    // whatever it may already have written is cleared by the steps below rather than after them.

    // NOTE: All three per-conversation job kinds that can still post AT the customer. MEMORY_COMPACT is

    // and the advisory lock the clear takes is what serializes it.

    // asks. Skipped when the answer is already yes, so an ordinary reset does not spend two admin
    // calls undoing nothing.
    //
    // `returnConversationToAgent` and not a local unassign+toggle: the ORDER is load-bearing and
    // documented there, the two cannot collapse into one `toggle_status`, and it mirrors the write
    // so the very next delivery passes the gate instead of waiting for a Chatwoot event.
    //
    // Only when the blocker is OWNERSHIP. A disabled agent is the one case where returning the
    // conversation makes things worse than leaving them: the runtime refuses to run a disabled agent
    // (the away-message branch says so in as many words), so an unassign would take the human off a
    // conversation nothing is left to answer. The command still clears everything else — starting the
    // episode over before switching the agent back on is a reasonable thing to want — and says what
    // it did not do.
    // Everything below decides from the MIRROR, and the mirror lags Chatwoot by one webhook. That is
    // fine for the rest of the command — it acts on our own state — but the hand-back is the one act
    // here that reaches a third party, taking a conversation away from whoever holds it. A human who
    // took over during the cleanup (a dozen network calls long) may not have arrived in the mirror
    // yet, and then `heldBySameParty` compares a stale holder against itself, answers "unchanged",
    // and the command unassigns the very takeover the fence exists to protect.
    //
    // A REFRESH of the mirror, not a second read beside it: the four fences that follow
    // (answerBlocker, heldBySameParty, and the ack's own recheck) all read that row, and answering
    // one of them from a different source is how two fences come to disagree about who holds a
    // conversation. reconcileMirrorFromLive is also the versioned path — a webhook that landed with
    // something newer wins instead of being overwritten by this GET — and it is the same probe
    // `runAgentNudge` runs before ITS irreversible act, for the same reason.
    //
    // Best-effort on purpose. Failing to refresh leaves the decision exactly where it stood before
    // this line, which is where it stood for every round of this PR; it does not warrant telling the
    // operator the assignment failed, so it is logged rather than collected into `failed`.

    // restore what the clear deletes). This is the SECOND thing one in-flight turn breaks, and it
    // breaks it in the opposite direction: that turn is carrying a reply composed BEFORE the operator
    // asked for a clean slate, and the takeover is the only thing currently keeping it quiet. Its
    // ownership recheck reads the mirror for exactly two fields (../../graph/runtime.ts, the
    // `shouldBotHandle` recheck) — status `pending` and no assignee — which is precisely the state a
    // successful hand-back writes. Returning the conversation therefore un-silences the stale reply
    // and posts it over the human who had claimed the conversation.
    //
    // WHAT GETS HERE IS A RUN NOTHING CAN CALL OFF, and since issue #449 the direct webhook turn is
    // no longer one of those: it carries the episode fence (../../graph/reset-episode.ts), which
    // stands it down at every send and, now, at its tool boundary. A debounced flush is retired
    // through its own job. What is left is the run with neither — a follow-up NUDGE, which claims the
    // graph key while posting into this conversation and is asked nothing at all — and the takeover
    // is the only thing keeping that one quiet.
    //
    // Checked in memory and outside the memory step's lock, which is enough for the harm named: a
    // turn that starts AFTER this line loads the memory the reset just cleared, so it is not the
    // stale turn this guards against.
    //
    // Standing down is the honest answer and not a lesser one — the conversation stays exactly where
    // the operator found it, the acknowledgement says so and why, and `/reset` typed again once the
    // turn lands finds nothing stale left to release.
    //
    // BOTH markers, because a turn sets two and they are not interchangeable. The per-conversation
    // one is claimed at the top of the turn (../../graph/runtime.ts, at `status.started()`); the
    // graph one only later, inside the ingest lock, after the checkpointer and the divider write. A
    // turn caught between them is running and posting into this very conversation while the graph
    // key still reads free. The conversation key also carries the case a contact-inbox id cannot:
    // with `contactInboxId` null the graph thread IS the conversation thread, and a guard that gave
    // up on the null asked nothing at all. And a follow-up nudge claims ONLY the graph key
    // (../../graph/nudge.ts) while posting into the conversation, so neither key alone is the

  // eager-media and test-mode gates require isNewIncoming or hasLateMedia, `commandActive` reads a
  // `command` that is null off anything but a new incoming message, and the channel-redirect
  // follow-up arm sits inside `if (act && isNewIncoming)`. The only branches this reaches are the
  // takeover and the ingestion, both at the bottom of this function.
  //
  // Issue #430 widened the predicate itself, not this condition: the class of event is the same one
  // (`message_created`, outgoing, a person wrote it), reached by a second route. The sweep above was
  // re-run against it and the answer did not change.
  // ...AND THE WRITE-BACK UPDATE (issue #478), which is the fourth class and the one this predicate
  // refused for as long as it existed. Without it the transcription of a voice note nobody answers
  // reaches no memory at all: the creation had no attachment and rendered to nothing, the delivery
  // that transcribed armed the append, and if that arm failed there was no second chance — and on a
  // fork that transcribes elsewhere, no first one either.
  //
  // THE SWEEP THE PARAGRAPH ABOVE DEMANDS, re-run against this class rather than inherited:
  //  - `command` is `isNewIncoming ? controlCommand(n) : null`, so every command branch stays inert;
  //  - the eager-media pass and `activatedTestLateMedia` both require `isNewIncoming || hasLateMedia`,
  //    so nothing re-analyses and no provider is called twice;
  //  - the debounce arm, the follow-up cancel and the channel-redirect arm all sit inside
  //    `isNewIncoming`;
  //  - the takeover reads `mayBeHumanReply`, which is false on an incoming message;
  //  - the mirror and the resolve branches never depended on `rt` being null and run either way.
  // What is left is the ingestion, which is the point.
  //
  // AND IT CANNOT DOUBLE-APPEND: `armIngest` keys the job by (thread, message) with `rearm:
  // "same-work"`, so the write-back's arm and the transcribing delivery's arm are the same row, and
  // once the job has run the id is in the dedup window and the second verdict is `duplicate`.
  // NOTE: THE WIRE'S ANSWER, which is the right one for the two decisions made here: whether the event
  // reaches the runtime at all, and which message the responder-coverage check is about. Both run
  // before anything has looked at the audio. The eager pass can produce a transcription later, and

  //    idempotent under a re-delivered webhook AND against the ladder's own timed "closing" stage (only
  //    one of them delivers). Detected off the mirror's fresh prevStatus→status transition. Applies to

  //    never a message, so not gated on isNewIncoming). Best-effort: a failure must not strand the

  // THE WATCHER'S FINAL VERDICT (issue #477), armed off the resolve EVENT on the route it arrives
  // on, and not off the mirror's transition below. With an observer beside a responder the same
  // resolve reaches each bot on its own route, and the transition is applied by whichever route
  // mirrors it first — the other reads a conversation already resolved and would arm nothing. The
  // row is one per conversation, so the second arm folds into the first; Chatwoot's two resolve
  // events fold the same way. For the responder when it is the one monitoring, and for the route's
  // own observer when there is one. Best-effort, like the compaction below.
  //
  // ...but only while the conversation IS resolved, which is the mirror's answer and not the
  // payload's (issue #477 review, round 2). Arming off the event is what lets the second route arm
  // at all, and it also trusts a payload the mirror REJECTED as out of order: a delayed `resolved`
  // landing after a newer event reopened the conversation would pull the verdict forward and let an
  // `on_resolve` agent relabel a live conversation. The mirror's status is the effective one in both
  // cases — applied by this delivery, or already applied by the other route — so it separates the
  // second route from a stale event, which `mirror.applied` alone cannot. `effectiveStatus` falls back
  // to the payload where the mirror read nothing, so a status nothing could store still arms.

  //
  // MEASURED, on a live fork, and it is the reason this exists at all: neither route moves the status
  // by itself. A composer reply on a `pending`, bot-owned conversation leaves it `pending` with no
  // assignee even under `enable_auto_assignment`, and so does a reply typed on the paired phone —
  // the fork hard-returns `false` from `captain_pending_conversation?`, so Chatwoot's own
  // `mark_pending_conversation_as_open_for_human_response` never fires. The next customer message
  // then drives a full turn, with the agent speaking into a thread a colleague is already holding.

  // conversation when this event was mirrored; the second half is a versioned compare-and-swap on the
  // mirrored row, asked and applied as one statement by the shared unit's fence, because everything
  // between the two is time a person can claim, resolve or reassign the conversation in — and one of

  // looks exactly like the state this decision was made about.
  //
  // Not idempotent by bookkeeping but by the gate: a re-delivered webhook finds the conversation no
  // longer `pending`, `act` is false, and nothing is written or logged a second time.

  // Production only, and NOT "enabled only", which is where this first landed. A takeover is a fact
  // about the CONVERSATION — a person is on it — and the switch is a fact about the agent, so
  // reading the switch here answers the wrong question. Two ways it went wrong: the post-model
  // recheck in ../../graph/runtime rechecks OWNERSHIP and not the switch, so a turn already running
  // when the agent was switched off still answers, over a colleague this block would have stepped
  // aside for; and the conversation stays `pending`, so switching the agent back on hands it every
  // conversation a person picked up while it was off, silently.
  //
  // A TEST-mode agent is a different case and stays excluded: it lives in a conversation an operator
  // activated with /teste, and an operator answering from the composer mid-test would otherwise
  // silence the very agent they are testing, with the way back (/reset) a command they now have to
  // know about.

  // Best-effort in both directions: a failed toggle leaves the previous behaviour rather than
  // stranding the delivery, and it is logged rather than swallowed.
