    // other side's anchors and ladder standing, and the funnel can be re-run but not re-closed. The
    // operator resets the other side to finish the job.
    //
    // Reaching across needs to know WHICH widget chat opened from this entry, and that used to be

    // rows was a guess — on a command that cancels appointment reminders. Issue #222 removed that:
    // the widget row now records the entry conversation it opened from, so this direction is a
    // lookup rather than an inference.
    //
    // The scoping stands anyway, and deliberately. Widening what a /reset erases is a change to what
    // the operator asked for, on the command whose whole ordering above exists to bound what it
    // touches; it is the operator's call, not a side effect of the pairing becoming available. What
    // changed is that the reach is now implementable, not that it is wanted here.

    // FIRST among the mutations, and the ordering is the whole fence. Two races pull in opposite
    // directions and only this position settles both.
    //
    // Late is wrong because /reset is not atomic with the conversation: a message arriving during the
    // cleanup runs a turn that can book, reschedule, or re-enter the funnel, and a retirement running
    // after it kills work that belongs to the NEXT episode. Sparing that work by age does not
    // discriminate — enqueueJob re-arms by upsert, so `created_at` stays put and `updated_at` moves on
    // a claim (see cancelThreadAppointments). Retiring first needs no such test: the upsert
    // that re-arms writes `status: PENDING` with a fresh payload, so anything armed afterwards revives
    // its own row.
    //
    // Early is also what the watermarks need. Clearing the anchors first opens a gap in which a ladder
    // the worker has ALREADY claimed still passes its own fence — nothing has stamped it yet — and
    // runs to its closing, which re-sets `redirectClosedAt` on the row the command just cleared, on a
    // conversation it also resolves. With the stamp landing here, anything in flight stands down, and
    // whatever it may already have written is cleared by the steps below rather than after them.
    //
    // NOTE: All three per-conversation job kinds that can still post AT the customer. MEMORY_COMPACT is
    // cancelled further down and is the one genuine exception: it writes memory rather than messages,
    // and the advisory lock the clear takes is what serializes it.
    //
    // The inactivity follow-up was on `cancelPendingJob` and that was not enough, for the reason this

    // its pre-send ownership probe and is inside the model call, and its second probe — the one that
    // catches a takeover mid-run — asks whether the bot owns the conversation. The hand-back below

    // agent on the account, and nothing records who wrote one — the definitions are account-wide, so
    // the narrowest set this command could name still includes an operator's CRM field and an
    // integration's column. Deleting those is not undoable, and the cost of keeping them is that the
    // agent may not re-ask something it already knows.
    //
    // `voiceReply` above is the contrast that draws the line: it is OUR column, written only by our
    // own tool, so its provenance is total and clearing it is this command's business.
    //
    // NOTE: the agent still reads those attributes into its prompt after a reset, so a test run can
    // start over and skip a question it already has an answer for. Wanting them cleared is
    // legitimate; doing it safely needs provenance the schema does not carry today.
    // LAST, and that ordering is the point. The state that decides whether the agent may speak AT
    // ALL — `shouldBotHandle` needs both `status === "pending"` and an assignee that is not a human
    // — is also the state that makes the NEXT delivery actionable. Returned first, a customer
    // message arriving while the steps above are still running passes the gate and starts a turn on
    // the very episode this command is in the middle of erasing: memory not yet cleared, attributes
    // still set, the previous ladder still armed. Returned last, that window holds the human's
    // ownership, which is the state the conversation was already in.
    //
    // The reason the rest of this command was useless after a handoff, and the reason it runs at
    // all: the canonical test loop — activate with /teste, let the agent transfer to a human,
    // resolve, start over — ended with a conversation that announces itself as active and then never
    // answers, and the only thing that undid it was "Devolver para IA" in the console. That is
    // behind a login, and the common case is an operator handing a test agent to a client who has
    // Chatwoot and no console at all.
    //
    // `stillOurs()` rather than testing the assignee alone: an assignment to another persona's bot,
    // or a conversation left `open`, silences it just as effectively — and it asks about the persona
    // bound to THIS INBOX from a FRESH read, which is the same question the acknowledgement below
    // asks. Skipped when the answer is already yes, so an ordinary reset does not spend two admin
    // calls undoing nothing.
    //
    // `returnConversationToAgent` and not a local unassign+toggle: the ORDER is load-bearing and
    // documented there, the two cannot collapse into one `toggle_status`, and it mirrors the write
    // so the very next delivery passes the gate instead of waiting for a Chatwoot event.
    //
    // Only when the blocker is OWNERSHIP. A disabled agent is the one case where returning the
    // conversation makes things worse than leaving them: the runtime refuses to run a disabled agent
    // (the away-message branch says so in as many words), so an unassign would take the human off a
    // conversation nothing is left to answer. The command still clears everything else — starting the
    // episode over before switching the agent back on is a reasonable thing to want — and says what
    // it did not do.
    // Everything below decides from the MIRROR, and the mirror lags Chatwoot by one webhook. That is
    // fine for the rest of the command — it acts on our own state — but the hand-back is the one act
    // here that reaches a third party, taking a conversation away from whoever holds it. A human who
    // took over during the cleanup (a dozen network calls long) may not have arrived in the mirror
    // yet, and then `heldBySameParty` compares a stale holder against itself, answers "unchanged",
    // and the command unassigns the very takeover the fence exists to protect.
    //
    // A REFRESH of the mirror, not a second read beside it: the four fences that follow
    // (answerBlocker, heldBySameParty, and the ack's own recheck) all read that row, and answering
    // one of them from a different source is how two fences come to disagree about who holds a
    // conversation. reconcileMirrorFromLive is also the versioned path — a webhook that landed with
    // something newer wins instead of being overwritten by this GET — and it is the same probe
    // `runAgentNudge` runs before ITS irreversible act, for the same reason.
    //
    // Best-effort on purpose. Failing to refresh leaves the decision exactly where it stood before
    // this line, which is where it stood for every round of this PR; it does not warrant telling the
    // operator the assignment failed, so it is logged rather than collected into `failed`.

    // restore what the clear deletes). This is the SECOND thing one in-flight turn breaks, and it
    // breaks it in the opposite direction: that turn is carrying a reply composed BEFORE the operator
    // asked for a clean slate, and the takeover is the only thing currently keeping it quiet. Its
    // ownership recheck reads the mirror for exactly two fields (../../graph/runtime.ts, the
    // `shouldBotHandle` recheck) — status `pending` and no assignee — which is precisely the state a
    // successful hand-back writes. Returning the conversation therefore un-silences the stale reply
    // and posts it over the human who had claimed the conversation.
    //
    // The direct webhook turn is the one that gets here: it passes `stillWanted: null`, so nothing
    // can call it off once it is invoking. A debounced flush is retired through its own job and
    // stands down by itself.
    //
    // Checked in memory and outside the memory step's lock, which is enough for the harm named: a
    // turn that starts AFTER this line loads the memory the reset just cleared, so it is not the
    // stale turn this guards against.
    //

    // the operator found it, the acknowledgement says so and why, and `/reset` typed again once the
    // turn lands finds nothing stale left to release.

    // one is claimed at the top of the turn (../../graph/runtime.ts, at `status.started()`); the

    // up on the null asked nothing at all. And a follow-up nudge claims ONLY the graph key

    // bot re-coalesces from that watermark and ANSWERS the message a gate deliberately suppressed —
    // a reply the product decided not to send, with nothing anywhere reporting it. Watermark first
