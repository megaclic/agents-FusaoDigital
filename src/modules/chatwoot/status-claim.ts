/**
 * The local status claim: what a status write made on THIS side announces about itself, so a payload
 * serialized before it cannot walk it back (issue #436).
 *
 * Pure: no DB, no clock of its own. The writers stamp what these functions compute, and
 * `decideConversationWrites` and the takeover's fence ask them what a stored pair means.
 *
 * ## Why a version cannot do this job
 *
 * Every other out-of-order question in this module is settled by `conversation.updated_at`: the
 * source's own version stamp, serialized together with the state it describes (state-order.ts). A
 * write made HERE has none to offer — the toggle endpoint renders a status blob and never that field
 * (issue #77) — so the human-reply takeover's `open` lands with the ordering marks exactly where they
 * were, and anything still in flight compares greater and wins.
 *
 * The tempting repair is to give the claim the version it was taken AT and refuse whatever is not
 * strictly ahead of it. Measured on the fork, that separates nothing: a customer message advances
 * `updated_at` on its own account (`set_conversation_activity` writes the conversation row), so a
 * snapshot serialized a moment BEFORE our toggle carries a higher version than the state we decided
 * on, exactly like one serialized after it. There is no reading of that clock which tells the two
 * apart, which is why the write has to announce itself instead of borrowing one.
 *
 * ## What a claim refuses, and what it must not
 *
 * ONE status: the one it is replacing. A payload restating it while the claim is live is a snapshot
 * from before the write — the two shapes issue #436 measured, a customer message carrying the reopen
 * exception and a delayed or companion `conversation_*` event, are both exactly that.
 *
 * A payload stating anything ELSE is news, and an operator resolving the conversation inside the
 * claim produces one event we ack and Chatwoot never redelivers — so a blanket fence would lose that
 * resolve for good, with no later event on a resolved conversation to repair it. The single
 * exception, and why it is keyed on the status the ROW holds, is on `statusClaimVerdict`.
 *
 * ## Only a write that moves FIRST can take one
 *
 * The takeover writes the row and THEN calls Chatwoot, deliberately, because every reader that
 * decides whether the agent may speak reads the row. That order is what makes the claim meaningful:
 * until the toggle answers, the source has not decided, and a payload stating the old status is a
 * snapshot from before the write.
 *
 * A caller that writes to Chatwoot FIRST and mirrors afterwards — the console's status buttons, whose
 * live read can leave them writing unversioned (issue #77) — has nothing in flight to fence, and
 * giving it a claim was measured to be worse than the gap it closed: it left the mirror refusing the
 * state every later payload reported, and it made the takeover's own fence skip a colleague who
 * replied AFTER the operator's click. That gap is real and is issue #469; it needs an axis this file
 * does not have, since neither side of it can offer a version.
 *
 * ## How a claim ends, and why nothing ends it early
 *
 * In two steps, and they are not the same step because they cover different routes.
 *
 * Its ORDERED half ends the moment the source stamps a version for OUR OWN transition, which is what
 * the takeover's live read goes and gets (`statusClaimStampedAt`). Before that instant there is
 * nothing to place a payload against, and no reading of the row supplies one: a mark that moved
 * proves only that some write reached us, never that it was ours or that it came after ours (issue
 * #468, rounds 4 to 6, which is three ways of learning the same thing). After it the question is
 * ordinary again — a version STRICTLY ahead of the one our transition carries was committed after
 * it, and is a hand-back that has to land.
 *
 * What that leaves is the gap itself, and the payloads that fall in it are not dropped, they are
 * DEFERRED: the newest version refused there is kept on the row (`statusClaimRefusedAt`), and the
 * reconcile that stamps our version adjudicates it against that version. Older is a snapshot frozen
 * before our write, and goes; newer is a transition committed after it — a colleague handing the
 * conversation back while the toggle was on the wire — and the status it restated is the one that
 * stands. This is what keeps the refusal from being a loss: we ack every one of those events and
 * Chatwoot never redelivers them.
 *
 * The rest of the claim's life covers the one route no version can order — the reopen exception,
 * which a message payload carries and which compares whole seconds against the status mark, so a
 * message frozen in the same second as the toggle wins even against the version the reconcile just
 * stamped. That is the shape measured live, and it is why the claim does not simply retire at the
 * reconcile.
 *
 * And NOTHING ends it early, because no outcome makes an unconfirmed local `open` safe to un-fence. A
 * toggle that throws is an UNKNOWN outcome, not a refusal: Chatwoot commits the transition and the
 * response is lost, and there is nothing in the error that tells that apart from a request the server
 * never applied. Releasing there would let a payload frozen before the toggle put the agent straight
 * back into a conversation the platform HAS handed over — the defect this exists to prevent,
 * reintroduced by the recovery. What the deadline costs on that path is a delay: the conversation
 * Chatwoot really did leave `pending` comes back to the agent when the claim runs out, instead of on
 * the next customer message. A deferred version costs the same, and for the same reason — nothing
 * ever stamps it, so nothing adjudicates it.
 *
 * ## What this cannot do on a Chatwoot that sends no version
 *
 * Everything above is written in versions, and an instance older than 4.0.2 sends none. There the
 * claim never gets stamped and nothing refused inside it can be adjudicated, so a hand-back made
 * during the window is refused and stays refused: the mirror keeps the agent OUT of a conversation
 * the platform returned to it, until the deadline passes and some later payload restates `pending`.
 * That is the safe direction of the same coin — the alternative is applying a snapshot we cannot
 * place, which is issue #436 itself — but it is a real cost, and it is the reason the deadline is
 * measured in tens of seconds rather than minutes.
 *
 * ## Why a deadline
 *
 * A claim its own process died holding is one no writer can end, and a claim with no end would fence
 * that conversation's status forever. So it carries the instant it stops mattering, and a crash costs
 * the window rather than the row: past it, the behaviour is the one this release replaced.

//
//   * the writer's own round trips — the toggle and the live read that stamps a version on it, at

//   * Chatwoot's redelivery ladder — `AgentBots::WebhookJob` retries 3 times, 3s apart
//     (state-order.ts, point 5), so a payload frozen before the toggle can still arrive ~9s after it
//     commits.
//
// Rounded up to 45s. A claim that expired mid-flight would be no worse than no claim, but it would be
// a fence that reports protection it is not giving, which is the failure mode that costs a rodada.
