// A delivery gates on a PAYLOAD, and every payload is a snapshot of an earlier instant: Chatwoot

// 1), and a delivery recovery rebuilds one from reads it made a moment before (#295). Beside it
// sits the MIRROR row as it stands after this event was written — a different instant again.
//
// Neither reading is uniformly the newer one, so this does not pick by recency. It picks by which
// way a wrong answer fails. A reading that says SOMEBODY ELSE HOLDS IT can only cost silence: the
// event that releases the conversation is a conversation-level one, it applies when it lands, and
// the next delivery passes. A reading that says NOBODY DOES costs an answer posted over a human who
// had just taken over — and posted is the smaller half of it, because the runtime's ownership
// re-check runs after the model call (../../graph/runtime.ts), so the turn has already run every
// tool it chose by the time anything withholds the text.
//
// So: whichever witness says the conversation is held is the one believed, and the payload's
// statement is preferred over the mirror only where neither says so.
//
// The asymmetry is not this function's invention — it is the mirror's rule read from the gate's
// side. A message snapshot may never write the assignee at all (state-order.ts: `assigneeOrdered`
// requires `fromConversationEvent`), so a mirror that reads human-owned under a payload that reads
// bot-owned is the mirror doing its job, not lagging. MEASURED on the recovery, where the window is
// widest: a human taking the conversation between the last mirror read and the gate got a full turn
// run against them, tools included.

//   a CSAT survey                         outgoing  null    false    {}          (content_type input_csat)
//   AN ATTENDANT ON THE PAIRED PHONE      outgoing  null    false    {external_created_at, external_sender_name: "WhatsApp"}
//

// the wire, not inferred. Under a bare "outgoing and sender-less" test, an operator's automation
// rule would read as a person taking the conversation over, and the switch below would silence the
// agent on it permanently. Only the last row carries the marker, and every WhatsApp session path in
// the fork writes it (baileys, zapi, the session inbound writer, the reaction store), so this reads
// the provider the operator actually runs rather than the one the issue was reported on.
//
// `sender == null` stays as a second clause rather than being dropped for the marker alone: the two
// are independent statements about the row (nobody in Chatwoot wrote it / it arrived from the
// session), and requiring both is what keeps a future fork that stamps the marker on a
// Chatwoot-originated row from reaching this.
//
// `imported` is UNREACHABLE through this event today and is kept anyway. Whatsapp::Session::SilentWrite
// wraps the whole import run and its SyncDispatcher guard calls ActionCableListener and nothing else,
// so AgentBotListener never fires for a backfilled row at either level of the flag — probed on the
// fork, not assumed. It stays because the two repositories ship on different clocks and the failure
// it fences is not proportional to its cost: one boolean read against an import quietly opening and
// silencing an operator's entire backlog, hundreds of conversations at once, on the day they pair a
// phone.
// THE PAYLOAD HALF, on its own, because the two halves are answered at different moments. The
// provider comes from the mirrored inbox row, and resolving that row is itself gated on "could this
// event be a human reply at all" — so this superset decides whether to pay for the lookup, and
