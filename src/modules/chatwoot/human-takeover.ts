//
// It lives here rather than inline in the delivery because it now has TWO callers that are not the
// same process. The live one is the delivery that carried the reply; the other is the recovery for a
// delivery a process death stranded before this ever ran (issue #439, ./recover-takeover.ts). The
// second caller is the whole reason for the file: re-implementing these steps there would be a
// second copy of a fence whose every clause was paid for by a measurement, and the repo's own record
// says which way that goes — a second spelling is how one of the clauses comes to be missing from
// one of the two.
//
// WHAT THE CALLER STILL DECIDES, and it is deliberately not in here: whether a takeover is owed at
// all. That question is about the EVENT (a person wrote it, by which route) and about the AGENT
// (production, the switch in its settings), and the two callers answer it from different evidence —
// the live one from the payload it holds, the recovery from the shape the ledger kept. What is in
// here is what happens once the answer is yes, which is identical for both.
//
// The three primitives below moved with it, unchanged: they are the fence, the local handover and
// the toggle, and the gate's own gate-close path calls two of them.

// WHETHER THE BOT STILL OWNS THIS CONVERSATION, read fresh from the mirror.
//
// One speller, because two callers ask it and they must agree: the gate's own fence
// (maybeConsumeCommandOrGate) and the human-reply takeover at the tail of handleDelivery. A second
// copy is how one of them comes to be missing a clause — this one has two that are not obvious.
//
// No resolvable persona means nothing can speak here, and "an AgentBot owns this" cannot be narrowed
// to "the sender owns this" without an id to compare against. shouldBotHandle answers the loose
// attribution question when the id is missing (its other callers depend on that), so the strict half
// is decided here, where the absence is known.
//
// NOTE: no test distinguishes that line today, and that is not an oversight: a persona that failed to
// resolve also leaves the client with an empty bot token, which never reaches the network. The line
// is here because the fence's answer must be right on its own terms — "we own this" is false when
// there is no "we" — rather than right because a lookup two layers down happens to fail too.
// EXACTLY THE COLUMNS THE FENCE ASKS FOR, named here because a test cannot identify this read any
// other way: the config load reads the same row with a superset of them, so a probe that wanted to
// stand in the fence's shoes has to match the projection WHOLE. Kept as one definition rather than
// copied into each probe, because a column added to the fence would otherwise silently stop three
// tests from injecting anything while leaving them green — and the projection was never the rule,
// only the proxy for "this is the fence's read".
//

// per caller (issue #146): the fence below is the part that is easy to leave out, and a second copy
// of it would be the copy that forgets.
//
// The fence: deciding to hand over can take time — a gate waits on somebody else's endpoint, and
// building the client resolves DNS — and a human can claim, resolve or reassign the conversation
// while it does. Without the re-check the copy was correctly withheld and the conversation was
// reopened and re-routed anyway, pulling a human's conversation back out of their hands by a gate
// that had already decided to stay quiet.
//
// THE CLIENT IS BUILT FIRST, and the fence answered after it, which is the whole point of the order.
// `assertSafeOutboundUrl` resolves the base URL's host, so constructing the client is a network round
// trip; asking first and building second puts that trip BETWEEN the answer and the write it guards,
// which is the window the fence exists to close. Nothing is written while the client is built, so

    // unknown puts the agent back to speaking into a conversation the platform HAS handed over,
    // which is the defect this whole block exists to prevent, reintroduced by the recovery.
    //
    // So the claim stands and the agent stays quiet, which is the direction a fence must fail in.
    // The disagreement is not durable either: the next customer message carries the reopen
    // exception (state-order.ts), so a conversation Chatwoot really did leave `pending` comes back
    // to the agent on its own, and one Chatwoot really did open stays open.
    //
    // AND THE CLAIM SAYS SO ON THE ROW UNTIL THE RECONCILE STAMPS IT (issue #436). Deliveries for
    // a conversation are dispatched detached and never serialized (chatwoot.controller.ts), so
    // anything committing between the write above and the reconcile below does so against a row
    // whose `chatwoot_status_at` still names the state before the claim — and the three ways in
    // were measured, not supposed:
    //
    //   - a customer message serialized before Chatwoot committed the toggle carries the old
    //     `pending`, and the reopen exception lets a message move status;
    //   - a delayed or companion `conversation_*` event carrying that same pre-takeover `pending`
    //     wins on version, because the claim advanced none;
    //   - on a deployment that sends no `updated_at` at all, the ordering check above is skipped
    //     and a hand-back committed while the client is built is captured as the current state.
    //
    // In each the row went back to `pending` and a turn passed its recheck and answered over the
    // person. What closes all three is the claim: it is refused by name, by the same rule and in
    // the same place every other ordering question is decided (state-order.ts), and it needs no
    // version, which is what the third way in has none of.
    //
    // AND A FAILED OPEN KEEPS IT, which is the same answer #430 already gives to the claim itself.
    // A toggle that throws is an UNKNOWN outcome, not a refusal — Chatwoot commits the transition
    // and the response is lost — so releasing here would let a payload frozen before the toggle put
    // the agent straight back into a conversation the platform HAS handed over. What the deadline
    // costs on this path is a delay rather than the recovery: the conversation Chatwoot really did
    // leave `pending` comes back to the agent when the claim runs out, instead of on the next
    // customer message.
    //
    // Refused by the fence, or the write failed: both are already reported by the shared unit, and
    // neither is a takeover — so nothing below runs. NOT a `return`: the delivery still has its
    // memory ingestion to arm and its row to mark processed.
