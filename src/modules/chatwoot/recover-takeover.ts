// Re-running the human-reply takeover a process death lost (issue #439).
//
// The sweep (issue #228) reports a delivery nothing finished; the recovery for a delivery that
// carried a CUSTOMER message answers it by running the delivery path again (issue #295). This is the
// third case, and it is neither: the delivery carried a COLLEAGUE's reply, so nothing is owed to the
// customer and nothing is lost from the loss list — what was lost is a SIDE EFFECT, the transition
// that steps the agent off the conversation (issue #430).
//
// WHY NOT THE DELIVERY PATH, which is what the other recovery does and is the obvious answer here
// too. That path takes a webhook body, and the body of an OUTGOING message is the one thing the
// ledger cannot rebuild: `buildRecoveryPayload` reads the message over REST by its id, and the id of
// an outgoing message is deliberately not stored (only a new INCOMING one is — see the ledger's
// `inboundMessageId`). Rebuilding a body with a synthetic message would then drive the continuous
// ingestion with content nobody wrote, into the contact's permanent memory. So this runs the
// takeover itself, through the same unit the live delivery runs (./human-takeover.ts) — not a second
// implementation of it, which is the defect this repo keeps paying for.
//
// NO MODEL AND NO ALERT, which is the whole reason the sweep needed a verdict of its own for it. The
// alternative on the table was to classify these rows `lost`, and that is wrong in both directions
// at once: it pages an operator about a message nobody lost, and it arms a turn to answer a reply
// that was ours.
//
// WHAT IS RE-DECIDED HERE rather than carried: the ROUTE's provider half (the ledger stores the
// payload's shape, and `device` is also what an unreserved provider's echo of our own reply looks
// like), the agent's mode and takeover switch, and ownership. All of it is read as it stands NOW,
// which is what the live path does too — it reads them at its own moment.
//
// AND NO VERSION IS CARRIED, which is a decision and the one place this deliberately differs from
// the live path. There, the takeover compares the payload's `conversation.updated_at` against the
// row's status mark, so a hand-back committed after the reply outranks it — the two `pending`s
// otherwise look identical. Transplanted here that check refuses almost everything, and MEASURED
// exactly where it matters: `chatwootStatusAt` is a version, not a change stamp, so it advances on
// every payload that DECLARES a status, the customer's own next message included (state-order.ts).
// The live check works because its payload is seconds old; a recovery's decision is half an hour
// old, and a conversation the customer wrote on in between — which is precisely the conversation
// where the agent has been answering over a person — reads as "somebody answered later than you".
//
// It is the pattern the repo already has a name for: a version is not an identity, and a mark that
// advances on redeclaration cannot serve as one. What the recovery has instead is that it holds no
// frozen snapshot at all: it reads the state NOW and writes one statement later, under a CAS on
// what it read. "Is my decision still the most recent one" is a question a stale payload has to ask;
// this one asks "does the state now allow the takeover", and ownership is the whole of that answer.
//
// THE COST, named rather than papered over: a hand-back that lands inside the sweep's window is
// undone by this, and the operator has to click "Return to AI" once more. That is the same class of
// gap as issue #469 and it errs in the direction a fence must err in — the failure is the agent
// staying quiet on a conversation a person can see in their queue, not the agent speaking over
// somebody, which is the defect issue #430 exists to prevent.
//
// NO AGE CEILING, unlike ./recover-delivery.ts, and the difference is what the two recover. That one
// SENDS A REPLY, so hours later it is a stranger reopening a conversation rather than a late answer.
// This one writes a status: a conversation still `pending` and still the bot's, hours after a person
// answered on it, is a conversation the agent is still wrong to be holding, and the fence refuses on
// its own the moment that stops being true.
