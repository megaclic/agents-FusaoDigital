// Answering the customer whose delivery a process death stranded (issue #295).
//
// The sweep (issue #228) says a message went unanswered; it does not answer it. This does, and the
// whole design is one sentence: RUN THE DELIVERY PATH AGAIN. Not a flush, and not a re-implementation
// of the gates.
//
// WHY NOT THE FLUSH, which was the obvious answer and is wrong. `flushDebounceJob` re-checks two
// gates itself, ownership and contact authorization, and it re-reads the conversation's messages
// from Chatwoot so the event body is not needed. But three gates run only in the delivery path and
// none of their verdicts survive the process that computed them: test mode, availability /
// out-of-hours, and the channel redirect. A recovery through the flush replies out of hours, or on a
// conversation whose test mode was never activated — a message the original delivery would have
// suppressed.
//
// Re-implementing those three here was the alternative, and it is worse than it looks: they are not
// predicates. Each one DECIDES AND ACTS — the redirect gate sends the link, availability posts the
// away message, test mode posts its notice — so a second implementation would have to reproduce the
// actions and their claims, not just the verdicts. And `isTestSilenced` already has five callers; a
// sixth is the shape of defect this repo keeps paying for.
//
// Re-running the delivery path is correct by construction: every gate runs where it already runs.
// What made that look unsafe was the fear of re-firing the side effects, and it does not hold — but
// the reason is PER GATE rather than one shared property, which is what reading all three actually
// showed:
//
//   - availability posts behind a real CAS. `claimAwayMessage` is an `updateMany` guarded on the
//     watermark's previous value and it claims BEFORE it posts, so a second invocation claims
//     nothing. The comment on it names why it had to be: "The webhook dispatch is DETACHED, so a
//     customer who writes twice in a row lands two invocations that both read the same watermark
//     before either writes it".
//   - the test notice (`testNoticeSentAt`) and the redirect (`redirectSentAt`) are one-shot
//     watermarks READ before the act and WRITTEN after it, which is not the same thing. They are
//     safe for a recovery for a different reason: a recovery is serialized against a live turn by
//     the in-flight fence below and against another recovery by the claim CAS, so its read of the
//     watermark is current rather than racing one.
//
// THE RESIDUAL WINDOW, named rather than papered over: a process that died BETWEEN one of those two
// acts and its watermark write leaves the watermark null, and the recovery repeats the act — a
// duplicate private note for the test notice, and for the redirect the fixed link sent to the
// customer a second time. Both are already reachable without any recovery, because the dispatch is
// detached and two live deliveries interleave the same way; neither spends a model call or writes
// conversation state. Closing it means a claim-then-act ordering inside three gates this does not
// own, which is a change to their contract and not to this one.
//
// AT LEAST ONCE, and that is a property of the design rather than a gap in it. A process that died
// left the customer unanswered — that is why the row is DEAD — but it did not necessarily do
// NOTHING first, and nothing in the ledger records how far it got. So a turn whose tools had already
// fired is re-run and fires them again. Closing that needs a durable per-effect claim, which is a
// change to the delivery path and to every tool, not to this. What IS refused here is the one class
// where a replay is destructive rather than merely repeated: a control command (`/reset` deletes the
// memory thread), which an operator authored and can retype.
//
// WHAT THIS DOES NOT DO, and it is a bound rather than an omission: it never runs a turn beside a
// live one. The turn-in-flight fence is consulted first, and it is in-memory — safe under the
// single-replica / one-leader invariant this whole repo already runs on, and the seven other modules
// that gate on it are the precedent. A turn live on ANOTHER replica is issue #203's gap, shared with
// every one of them.

// How many recoveries one stranded row may ever get. `attempts` is the ledger column that counts
// them, unused since the ledger was introduced and written for the first time by the claim in
// `processChatwootDelivery`.
//
// THREE, and the number is a policy rather than a measurement — said plainly because the alternative
// is a reader assuming it was tuned. What is NOT arbitrary is that a bound exists at all: a recovery
// runs a real turn, which spends the model and can call side-effecting tools, and a row that fails
// for a reason recovery cannot fix (a deleted conversation, a revoked token) would otherwise be
// retried for the life of the install.

// SIX HOURS, and like the attempt cap it is policy rather than measurement. What is not arbitrary is
// that a ceiling exists, and it answers two different questions with one rule:
//
//   - a reply is a RECOVERY only while the customer is still plausibly waiting. Hours later it is
//     not a late answer, it is a stranger reopening a conversation that moved on, and the operator's
//     DEAD worklist is the better place for it.
//   - the delivery path replies FREE-FORM, and deliberately applies no WhatsApp service-window check
//     because a reactive event has just arrived — which is true for a live delivery and is exactly
//     what a stale recovery breaks. Outside the 24h window an official provider rejects the send,
//     the path catches it, and the row is marked PROCESSED with the customer still unanswered. A
//     ceiling well inside any plausible window is what keeps that unreachable, rather than a second
//     copy of `proactiveSendMode` living here.
//
// What it does NOT cover, said plainly: an agent that configures `serviceWindow.windowHours` BELOW
// this ceiling. That install can still produce a recovery outside its own window.

// without a recovery, a stalled handler waking up and settling its own row takes the message off
// the `WHERE status = 'DEAD'` list exactly the same way — the recovery adds an actor, not an
// outcome. The second is that the missing CAS is a decision with its own written argument, on the
// other side of this one (see the settlement in ./webhook.ts): a turn that outlives the sweep's
// staleness threshold and then completes DID deliver, late, and winning there is what leaves the
// row saying the true thing. A generation counter would have to distinguish "completed late" from
// "woke up and failed", which is a question the delivery path does not currently answer about
// itself. That is its own piece of work, on the live path rather than here.
//
// What the round got wrong is the tail: a later recovery does not then report `superseded` and
// delete the message. It reads a row that is no longer `DEAD` and refuses before claiming anything.

  // recovery exists to answer, so the same word there would close the loss on a customer nobody
  // replied to and take the row out of the worklist. MEASURED before this: with the model throwing,
  // the recovery returned `recovered`, the row went `PROCESSED`, and nothing was sent.
  //
  // Asked for explicitly (`onDirectTurn`) rather than read back off the world afterwards. The two
  // readings available here — the conversation's recorded error, the absence of an outgoing message
  // — both answer about a MOMENT rather than about this turn: an error recorded by a previous
  // failure is still there, and an operator can post a reply of their own between the throw and any
  // read this side could make.
  // WHAT THE CLAIM DOES NOT DO IS REVOKE THE ORIGINAL HANDLER, and that is worth saying rather than
  // implying. `DEAD` is the sweep's verdict on a row nothing has moved for thirty minutes, and the
  // one shape it can be wrong about is a handler that is merely stalled: it holds no lock this side
  // can take away, so claiming the row from `DEAD` takes the LEDGER back and nothing else. If that
  // handler resumes, its own tx2 CAS finds the row gone and settles nothing — but whatever it did
  // before then is done.
  //
  // The overlap that matters is two INVOKES, and that one is fenced: a handler already inside
  // `runAgentTurn` holds the thread's durable claim (issue #203), which is exactly what the fence
  // above asks the row for, so the recovery defers rather than running beside it. What is left is a
  // handler stalled for half an hour BEFORE its turn — every await between the claim and
  // `runAgentTurn` is a scoped query or a REST read with its own deadline, so reaching that state
  // means the process is pathological rather than slow — and there the two turns overlap the way two
  // live deliveries for one conversation already can. The head of this file states the standing cost
  // that leaves: a recovery re-runs a turn that may call side-effecting tools.

  // defer on this conversation until the process restarts (../../graph/inflight.ts).
  // BOTH KEYS, and the second one is not a duplicate of the first. The conversation key is what
  // `followUpHandler` and a second recovery read, and holding it is what keeps them off this
  // conversation. `/reset` asks a different question — `threadBusyForResetOn`, which reads the GRAPH
  // key and the durable claim — because it is about to delete the memory and the checkpoint, and it
  // REFUSES while anyone is mid-write, on the grounds that the write would restore what it clears.
  //
  // Held only on the CONVERSATION key, this stretch was invisible to that question: a reset landing
  // between the mark and `runAgentTurn` taking its own claim saw an idle thread, cleared it, and the
  // recovery then ran the turn that restored the memory the operator had just erased, tools
  // included. MEASURED at the delivery path's own client build, which is inside this hold.
  //
  // The window is not narrow. Between here and the turn's claim sit the mirror write, the ownership
  // gates, the contact-authorization call and the spend ceiling, and the last two reach the network.
  //
  // Taken as RESERVATIONS rather than as invokes, and the difference is one reader. Every writer
  // asks `isTurnInFlight`, which counts both, so the reset, the append and the compaction all see
  // this stretch. `markTurnOwning` asks `isTurnRunning`, which does not — it is deciding whether
  // ANOTHER invoke was already reading the thread, and the answer defers the attendance divider and
  // the marker. Counted as an invoke, this hold answered that question about the caller itself:
  // MEASURED, a recovery that starts a NEW conversation on a contact thread that already had one ran
  // the model against the previous attendance with no divider between them, and left the marker on
  // the old conversation. Both maps COUNT rather than set (../../graph/inflight.ts), so the turn
  // taking the same graph key a moment later is an increment and not a conflict, and each hold is
  // balanced by its own clear.
  //
  // THE BOUND, stated rather than implied: both marks live in a Map in THIS process, and the durable
  // claim that crosses replicas is not taken until `runAgentTurn` takes it. A `/reset` served by a
  // different web replica reads neither, so it clears the memory and this turn restores it — the
  // same loss described above, on the topology where the fence cannot see it. Closing that means
  // taking the durable claim (`markTurnOwning`) here, and that is not a wider version of this hold:
  // it WAITS on an append's lease and on the reset's row lock, so it changes what the fence MEANS
  // rather than extending its reach. Tracked as issue #428 and NOT as #203's remaining edge, which
  // is what it was first written as: #203 enumerated three consumers of this fence and left two of
  // them deliberately, on the grounds that a compaction re-arms and a nudge races one reply. A reset
  // recovers from nothing — it is an operator's deliberate deletion, undone — so it is a fourth
