// Finds Chatwoot deliveries stranded by a process death and says so (issue #228). One DELIVERY_SWEEP
// job per tenant, armed at boot and when a Chatwoot account is connected, self-rearming.
//
// IT STILL DOES NOT ANSWER THE CUSTOMER ITSELF, and that is the design rather than a shortcut.
// Recovering the turn means running one, and a turn run from HERE is not the turn the delivery would
// have run: the flush machinery re-checks ownership and contact authorization itself, but the
// test-mode gate, the availability window and the redirect gate are applied by the delivery path and
// are gone with the process that died. Two earlier designs (arming the flush, running it inline)
// were both wrong for that same reason.
//
// What it does instead is arm one DELIVERY_RECOVERY per row it declares lost (issue #295), and that
// job re-runs the DELIVERY PATH, where every one of those gates already lives. A kind of its own
// because it spends a whole agent turn and this sweep spends an indexed query — lanes.ts states the
// rule, and folding the turn in here would start a batch's worth of them inside a job sized for
// queries.
//
// The reporting half stands on its own and is not conditional on the recovery working. The issue's
// harm has two halves — the message is gone, and it is gone SILENTLY — and this closes the second
// completely: every stranded row becomes terminal, `WHERE status = 'DEAD'` is the list of customers
// who wrote and were never answered, and each one leaves an error-level line on the conversation,
// which is what the console reads and what the alert channels dispatch.

// Longer than any legitimate delivery. There is no number to derive it from — the direct path runs
// the agent turn INSIDE `processChatwootDelivery` and neither the model call nor the tools have a
// timeout — so it is a policy choice, and generous on purpose.
//
// What being early costs is one false ALERT, not a second turn: nothing here acts on the
// conversation. A turn still running past this mark has its row marked DEAD and its loss
// dispatched, and then the turn finishes and `processChatwootDelivery`'s tx2 writes PROCESSED over
// it — by id, deliberately, so the row ends up saying the true thing (see the note there). The
// alert is what cannot be recalled. Thirty minutes puts that outside anything but a pathological
// turn; closing it properly needs the processor to heartbeat, which is machinery this does not
// carry.

// Retire the ledger rows of the messages a turn just ran over.
//
// This is the half that makes the sweep's question answerable. A delivery row records ONE message,
// and the question the sweep asks is about that message: did anything ever process it? Answering it
// by comparing the conversation's watermarks cannot work, and three review rounds of this PR each
// found a different way it fails — the watermark is a per-CONVERSATION high-water mark and the
// question is per-MESSAGE, so any scalar reading of it either closes real losses (a later
// deliberate skip moves it past an unanswered message) or reports answered ones.
//
// So the turn says so directly. A burst re-fetched from Chatwoot may contain messages whose own
// delivery DIED before finishing — that is exactly what the flush rescues, since it re-reads every
// message above the watermark rather than the one that armed it — and those rows are the ones this
// retires. In the ordinary case it updates nothing: a delivery that completed already reached
// PROCESSED on its own.
//
// It runs AFTER the turn, never at the post gate: the gate claims before the reply is sent, and
// retiring there would erase the evidence of precisely the crash window the sweep exists to catch.
// Which messages the decision covered, in the shape the caller can actually state it — and the two
// shapes are EXCLUSIVE, spelled as a union so the third combination cannot be written.
//
// It is not a stylistic union. Every field was optional once, and dropping all three left a filter
// with no message bound at all: `{ chatwootInstanceId, conversationId }`, which retires every
// non-terminal row on the conversation and closes whatever loss was sitting there. A `not: null`
// alarm was what stood between that call and the damage, on a filter whose whole job is to be
// narrow. There is now no such call to write.
//
//   The third is ONE ROW, and it exists because one of the callers does not speak for the
//   conversation. Chatwoot fans a message to up to TWO bot routes — `agent_bots_for` returns the
//   conversation's assignee bot AND the inbox's active bot, each with its own `delivery_id` — so a
//   message can hold two ledger rows that differ only by which bot received it. A gate exit taken
//   because the conversation is held by ANOTHER PARTY is not a statement that the message was
//   handled; it is a statement that WE are not handling it. Keyed by conversation and message, that
//   exit retires the other route's row, and if that route's process then dies the loss is invisible.
//   `deliveryRowId` is the caller saying "only the delivery I am".

  // The gate exits, which decide before any fetch and can only say what the watermark they advance

  // back past its own burst and retires a strand some earlier message left behind — the gate never
