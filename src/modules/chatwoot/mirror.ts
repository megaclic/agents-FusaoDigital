      // the previous one does not.

  // it: the watermark has to be per-contact. ONE statement ⇒ the compare-and-set is atomic under
  // concurrent deliveries, and every field is settled inside the same visit to the row.
  //
  // A watermark PER FIELD, not per row. A payload states a SUBSET of the identity, so a row-wide
  // position would be advanced by an event that never spoke about the field it then protects: a
  // name-only event at t3 would reject a phone clear from t2 arriving behind it, and the gate would
  // go on asking about a number the customer no longer has. Absent means "I know nothing about
  // this", and knowing nothing may not move anything, value or position.
  //
  // These are SOURCE positions, never receipt times: stamping an undated payload with our own clock
  // would make it beat every real Chatwoot timestamp and poison the ordering. An undated payload
  // therefore has NO position, and a write with no position is a write decided by arrival order —
  // the one thing this block exists to prevent — so it writes nothing at all. It used to be let
  // through as a "bootstrap" for a row nothing had positioned yet, except that the watermark stayed
  // null afterwards, so the next undated payload bootstrapped it again, and the one after that: two
  // degraded deliveries naming different phones settled it by whoever arrived last. The bootstrap
  // belongs to the `create` above, which runs exactly once per row. Identity only reaches us on
  // conversation and message events, which carry `last_activity_at` (bots never receive
  // `contact_updated`), so this is the degraded path, and the degraded path fails closed: a contact
  // with nothing positioned reads as `no_identity` at the gate.
  //
  // Each field has two ways to be written, and they are the two CASE arms below:
  //
  //   * STRICTLY NEWER than the field's position: the stated value wins and the position moves.
  //   * EQUAL to it: a tie, decided by DISAGREEMENT rather than arrival order. `last_activity_at`
  //     has one-second resolution, so two events inside one second cannot be ordered at all. Two
  //     payloads that AGREE are one event delivered twice and settle nothing new. Two that state
  //     different values are a conflict nothing can break, and there the field is emptied: keeping
  //     either is a coin toss about whose phone number this is, and the gate would carry the winner
  //     to the operator's endpoint as fact. The position does not move — a tie positions nothing.
  //
  // Anything older than the position falls through to ELSE and changes nothing.
