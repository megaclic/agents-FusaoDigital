// The same walker `redactSecretsDeep` is, aimed at the same kind of destination: `audit_logs.before`
// and `.after` are `jsonb`, so an unpaired surrogate anywhere in the projection makes Postgres refuse
// the whole write. Here the cost is worse than a lost log line — the change has already committed by
// the time this row is written, so it lands, the tool reports a failure, and the record of who made
// it is the only thing missing. Hence both repairs: `clipText` so the cut cannot manufacture an
// orphan, and `makeStorable` for one that arrived with the value (or for a NUL, which the same
// column refuses just as flatly): a projection carries some
// arguments as the MCP client sent them (`args.name`, `args.title`, `args.content`), and that JSON
// can spell one out.
//
// NOTE: KEYS are not repaired here, and that asymmetry with redactSecretsDeep is deliberate rather
// than an omission. Every key in a projection is a field name we wrote or an argument name taken
// from the tool's own schema; the one bag whose keys are open-ended (`agent.settings`) is read back
// out of a jsonb column, which is the very thing that cannot hold an orphan. The keys the other
// walker repairs come from a model's tool-call arguments and from third parties' response bodies.

// The only part of a URL an audit row keeps: its origin.
//
// A row OUTLIVES the record it describes. The live read surfaces return these URLs whole to the same
// tenant admins, but those are deletable and the trail is append-only, so a token pasted into one
// once outlasts every correction.
//
// EVERY other part goes, and the path goes with them. Userinfo, query and fragment are the three
// places a credential hides in the abstract; the path is where it actually turns up, because the
// destinations operators point these at put it there — a Discord incoming webhook is
// `…/api/webhooks/<id>/<token>`, and Slack's is the same shape. This codebase is its own evidence:
// an alert channel's URL is stored ENCRYPTED at rest for exactly that reason, and an outbound
// subscription accepts the same arbitrary HTTPS destination with its column in the clear.
//
// So there is one answer rather than one per caller. Keeping the path for the family whose column
// happens to be readable would be reasoning from where the value is stored to whether it is a
// secret, and the two are unrelated. Identity is not lost by this: the row's `target` names the
// subscription or the channel exactly, and what the origin adds is which host it was pointed at.

// What a stored credential reference contributes to a projection: the ref where it names an entry,

// anything else reads as null. The marker is what keeps the trail honest once that redaction exists:
// without it, clearing an unreadable value looks identical on both sides of the change,
// `projectionMoved` sees nothing, and the one save that removed a credential writes no row at all.
// Same shape as `secretRefOpaque` on the outbound subscription (#397), which is why it lives here
// rather than being spelled out at each of the three columns that need it.

// The other half of the rule: the columns a row may NOT publish, compared but never carried.
//
// The rule is that a mutable column is either projected in a form safe to keep forever, or listed
// here — never left out of both. Left out of both, the column changes and the projection does not,
// `projectionMoved` sees nothing, and the edit writes no row at all. That is not a corner: review
// found it on five columns at once (a tool's headers/body/schemas, an integration's config VALUES
// under unchanged keys, an experiment's variant prompts), and each of those is the ordinary edit its
// family gets.
//
// WHAT THE ROW KEEPS IS A BOOLEAN, and that is the whole point of the shape. These columns are the
// ones a row may not carry — a free-form bag nothing validated, a prompt, a document body — so
// anything DERIVED from them may not be carried either: an unsalted digest of a low-entropy value
// is an offline verifier for it, and `audit_logs` is append-only and readable by every tenant admin
// long after the record itself is deleted. The comparison happens here, in memory, on values that
// are already in hand; only the answer is stored. Same answer #394 reached for the settings bag
// (`src/modules/agents/audit-projection.ts`, `unreadConfigChanged`), for the same reason.

// would take the audit row down with the mutation it belongs to.

  // `null` — and `tests/modules/audit-config-families.test.ts` fails while a name in an
  // `UNDISCLOSED` list is not a key of that module's `select`, so it should never arise.
