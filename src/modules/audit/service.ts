// controllers reach the same functions — a change made in the console left no row at all. And it
// shares the mutation's transaction, so a lost row means a lost change: the second transaction the
// transport opened could fail on its own and leave the change with no record of who made it.

// `tenantId` is which trail the row joins, and it answers to the row that CHANGED, not to the
// principal that changed it. Two shapes need it and the plain `auditMutation` gets both wrong:
//
// - A fleet-level change belongs to no tenant (`null`). Branding is global, and a SUPER_ADMIN with a
//   tenant selected in the console has a `ctx.tenantId`, so keying on the context would file a change
//   to the whole deployment under whichever tenant the header happened to name.
// - A SUPER_ADMIN may write a tenant OTHER than the selected one: `PATCH /v1/tenants/7` succeeds with
//   `X-Tenant-Id: 5`, because the update runs `asSuperAdmin` and never consults the context (measured).
//   The row belongs to 7.
//
// And `null` is not merely "no tenant": those rows are the only ones that SURVIVE the tenant. Every
// audit row is `ON DELETE CASCADE` on its tenant, so a `tenant.delete` recorded against the tenant it
// deletes is erased by the same statement, leaving the one act whose record matters most with no
// record at all (measured).
