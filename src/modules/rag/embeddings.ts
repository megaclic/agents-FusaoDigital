// replaces had six. And an ingest failure is terminal: the document lands in FAILED and only a
// manual reindex moves it, which is a worse outcome than any single 503 deserves.
//
// Three attempts rather than six, because the same function serves `embedQuery` inside a live turn,
// where every extra attempt is a customer waiting; three with these delays is still strictly more
// patient than the zero this path shipped with, and strictly less than the six a 600s-default SDK

// A failure with no status at all is the case that divides them. `AsyncCaller` retried it (its
// `STATUS_NO_RETRY` list is statuses, so a connection reset falls through to a retry), and it is
// just as often a base URL that will never resolve. `modules/vision/retry` excludes it deliberately,
// because a customer is waiting on that turn and the operator needs a bad endpoint to fail on the
// first attempt. Both readings are right, for different callers:
//
//   embedTexts — the INGEST. Nobody is waiting, and the failure is terminal: the document lands in
//   FAILED and only a manual reindex moves it. A reset costs the document, so it is asked again.
//   embedQuery — a live TURN, where the retry is time a customer spends waiting for a search that
//   the turn can proceed without.

// retried on either: the endpoint answered, and it will answer the same way again.
