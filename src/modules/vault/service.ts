// Tenant-scoped secret vault. Secrets are encryptJson() base64 blobs in a String column
// (never Json, never logged). Reads/writes go through a ScopedDb so RLS scopes them to the
// active tenant; entries are referenced by the stable `vault:<id>` ref elsewhere
// (credentialRef, secretRef), and the REST surface manages them by id.

// A stored credential reference is always the stable `vault:<id>` form (the agent export/import
// JSON uses the entry NAME as its portable form, but it is translated to `vault:<id>` on import —
// see agents/transfer.ts). `vaultRefWhere` parses a ref to a Prisma filter; RLS scopes the row to
// the active tenant, so a foreign id reads back null (never cross-tenant). A value that is not a
// well-formed `vault:<id>` yields a never-matching filter (resolves to null).

// (src/client/lib/credentialRef.ts) states the contract every resolver keeps — `vault:0007`,
// `vault: 7` and `vault:7` are the same entry. Reading strictly would report a working credential as
// missing and silently switch a model or an integration off after an upgrade.
//
// What it does NOT tolerate is a value no `bigint` column can hold. `BigInt` is arbitrary precision,

// resolver whose contract is to answer "no such entry". Lenient about SPELLING, bounded by RANGE.

//
// Every ref column was guarded by `requireVaultRef` on all of its writers in one commit (#126, and
// the two `secretRef` columns are the measured case); before it the schema was
// `z.string().min(1).max(128)` and the value went in verbatim. So a row can hold arbitrary text — an
// API caller who read the field name as "the secret" and typed one in put it there — and a projection
// that echoes the column publishes it to every reader of that projection, which is exactly what the
// promise "the signing secret never leaves the vault" says cannot happen.
//
// What it proves is that the value IS a reference — the prefix plus an in-range integer — and not that
// the entry exists. That distinction is deliberate, and it is why the guard can stay a pure function.
// A ref whose entry was DELETED still comes back, so the picker can say "Credential unavailable" and
// the operator learns what happened; verifying existence would replace that with silence and put a
// tenant-scoped query inside every projection, including the ones that run in an audit transaction.
//
// The bound is what makes that safe rather than merely cheap: the output is never the stored string.
// It is `vault:` plus the DECIMAL rendering of a parsed BigInt in [0, MAX_DB_ID], so `vault:0x1F4`
// leaves as `vault:500` and everything an HMAC secret actually looks like — hex, base64, `sha256=…`,
// any bare name — reads as null. Reaching the remaining sliver takes a stored value of the form
// `vault:<digits>`, which is reference syntax: someone writing a raw secret writes the secret, not the
// prefix. (Review round 5 read this as a secret-disclosure path; the table in
// `tests/modules/alert-channel-secret-roundtrip.test.ts` is the measurement.)
//
// Canonical rather than verbatim for the values it DOES read: `vault: 7`, `vault:0007` and `vault:0x7`
// all name entry 7, and echoing the stored spelling would hand a client back something
// `requireVaultRef` refuses on the way in — a rename turned into an unsavable form.

// straight off the resolved entry, and vision, STT, TTS, the HTTP-tool base and the MCP connection
// URL do the same, none of them asking the kind. So an `openai` credential could carry a host the

// turn. The kind that legitimately points an OpenAI API somewhere else is `openai_compatible`, and

// by USE, not by a decision, so routing it through there puts a row into an append-only table every
// hour per connected credential, and the operator's own edits drown in machine bookkeeping. This
// family already answered that question once in the other direction (#395: the Channels page
// auto-syncs on load, so an unconditional `instance.sync_inboxes` recorded a row per account per
// visit, and the fix was to record only what actually moved).
//
// What moved is the line. An access token is a DERIVED, short-lived artifact of the credential; the
// refresh token and the granted scopes ARE the credential. A refresh token rotating replaces the
// durable secret and revokes the old one, and scopes changing under a refresh means the grant itself
// changed upstream: both are things an operator would want to find in the trail, and neither is
// hourly. The access token moving on its own is not, and gets no row.
//
// The comparison is against the value read HERE, under the row lock, and NOT against the snapshot
// the caller decrypted: that snapshot predates a network round trip to the provider, so two
// overlapping refreshes of the same expired credential would both compare with the same stale value
// and both record the same rotation. It is the same defect this module's own rule names (a row only
// when something changed), and the same shape as every other read that decided something a
// concurrent write could move underneath it. `FOR UPDATE` and not `FOR NO KEY UPDATE`, because that
// is the mode the rest of this module takes on this table and a mixed mode is a deadlock with no
// green test to show it (#395).
//
// `system` and a null actor, for the same reason /reset's rows are (#398): the refresh is triggered
// by a clock and a use, and the principal whose request happened to notice the expiry did not rotate
// anything. Left on `ctx` the row would name a person who did not act.
