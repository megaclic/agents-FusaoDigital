  // watermark after the nudge — and `lastFollowUpAt` is exactly the column /reset clears. A stamp
  // landing after the command puts the sweep's anchor back on a conversation the operator was told
  // was cleared, and the third one also arms the next step, reviving the sequence the command ended.
  //
  // Read immediately before each write rather than once at the top: the command arrives whenever it
  // arrives, and the interesting moment is precisely while the nudge's model call runs. Returns
  // whether the stamp landed, so a caller that would continue the sequence can stop instead.
  //
  // ONE statement, not a read then a write. Everywhere else the two marks are read to decide whether
  // to keep going, and the gap between deciding and acting is covered by there being no I/O in it.
  // Here the gap cannot be closed that way, because the command does two things in ORDER: it retires
  // the job first and clears `last_follow_up_at` later, so a stamp that reads between them finds the
  // job live, and writes after the clear. The condition therefore has to be evaluated by the same
  // statement that writes — then the stamp lands strictly before the retirement or not at all.
  //
  // The condition is `jobNotRetiredSql`, the scheduler's own predicate, and not a copy of it written
  // here: the JS reader and this one are one rule, and they are kept side by side there so a change
  // to either is a change in front of the other. NOT-retired rather than live, so an absent row
