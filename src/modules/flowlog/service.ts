// Execution-flow log emit core. Verbose, per-stage operational telemetry (one row per stage per
// turn) written FIRE-AND-FORGET: unlike UsageCapture (which awaits its single billing row), the
// hot WhatsApp path must not pay write latency for 6+ log lines, and losing a line at process
// shutdown is acceptable for operational logging. Every emit has its own try/catch — a rejected
// write (or alert dispatch) never escapes into the turn. NEVER log message text / PII: `detail`
// carries only ids/counts/enums and is passed through redactSecretsDeep as defense-in-depth.

// The ceiling a `detail` string is written under while the agent's debug mode is on (#58).
//
// Derived, not chosen. The largest operator-authored string the API accepts is `AGENT_PROMPT_MAX_CHARS`
// (100k by default, `src/api/v1/agents.controller.ts`), and the field the mode exists for is that
// prompt's AUDIT, which is the same text with its context placeholders rewritten as
// `{{canal: string(1234)}}`. Measured, that rewrite expands the template by 1.08x on ordinary prose
// and at most 2.56x in the worst case the closed context-variable set allows — `{{canal}}` is the
// shortest placeholder there is, at 9 characters, and its audited form is at most 23
// (`tests/modules/flowlog-debug-mode.test.ts` pins both numbers). Three times the prompt ceiling
// therefore covers any prompt this API would have accepted, with margin.
//
// It is still a BOUND, and that is the point of not simply removing the cap: `detail` also carries
// tool arguments and results, which no configuration limits, so an unbounded write would let one
// runaway tool response into a row.
//
// `Math.max` because the prompt ceiling is an operator's env var and nothing stops it being small:
// under 667 the derivation falls below the ordinary 2,000, and arming the debug mode would then
// SHRINK what a line stores. A mode that records less than the default is not a weaker version of
// itself, it is the opposite of what it says.
//
// The `+` term is the SCHEDULE allowance, and it is there because the audit does not only mask: it
// keeps the agent's own configured hours resolved, since those are often the whole answer to "why
// did it say we were closed". A rendered schedule is not small — at `MAX_SCHEDULE_WINDOWS` it turns
// a 23-character placeholder into ~2.6k — so the audit collapses repeats and keeps ONE full
// rendering per schedule variable name (`prompt-audit.ts`). Six names, and 4k each is generous for
// a 200-window summary (measured: 2,639 characters, ~13 per window), so this reserves what that
// rule can still add on top of the template.
//
// A bound, and only since issue #346. `MAX_SCHEDULE_WINDOWS` is asked at the READER (`parseWindows`),
// so no stored row surfaces more than it however it was written, and the reserve above therefore
// covers every schedule this runtime can render. It was a MARGIN while the number bounded only the
// business-hours API: the agent import wrote `windows` unvalidated, and one past the cap rendered
// past what is reserved here. That fallback is still here and still right — the audit is cut and the
// row stays bounded, because the ceiling is also a budget — but reaching it no longer takes a
// schedule. Reserving for an unbounded input is not possible, and that is why the input is bounded.
