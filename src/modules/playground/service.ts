// native CONVERSATION tools (handoff/resolve/…) ARE exposed but SIMULATED (no real effect), so the
// agent's decision to call them is testable; the operator can also mock ANY tool's result
// (`toolMocks`). Turns persist in the checkpointer under a tenant+agent-fenced playground thread, so
// the test session has memory. The agent's `enabled` toggle is ignored — you test before going live.

// The screening pass is a model call the operator pays for, on the one surface built for rapid
// iteration: an output turn can cost two on its own (`splitAnalyses` runs relevance alongside the
// rest), so a turn goes from one call to as many as three. On by default, because the playground's
// whole purpose is to show what the customer would get; off has to mean NO call, not a discarded
