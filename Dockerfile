# NOTE: We intentionally do NOT use `bun build --compile` here. The standalone-compiled binary
# (and any `bun build` bundle) segfaults at boot on this app: bundling triggers a Bun heap-corruption
# bug, pinned to executing `@elysiajs/static`'s staticPlugin in the bundled build. The interpreted
# source (`bun src/index.ts`) is immune. Full investigation + repro: docs/bun-compile-segfault.md.
# Revisit `--compile` once the Bun bug is fixed or staticPlugin is replaced.

# stdio MCP launchers (gated by MCP_STDIO_ENABLED). `bunx` is native to the Bun base image; `uvx`
# (from uv, a statically-linked binary) runs Python MCP servers. We pre-install a musl CPython into
# uv's default dir under root's HOME so the spawned MCP process finds it without extra env vars (the
# MCP stdio transport only forwards a safe env subset such as HOME/PATH, so UV_* dirs would not
# propagate). NOTE: musl Python builds are x86_64-only today (aarch64-musl cannot yet install Python
# via uv). Pin uv by tag; bump deliberately.
