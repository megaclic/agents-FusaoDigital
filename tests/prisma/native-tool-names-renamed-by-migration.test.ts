// and never reaches the model, so a name added to NATIVE_TOOL_NAMES ships with a migration that
// renames such rows (PR #485, round 15: `run_code`, and the thirteen names #457 reserved without
// one). The migration's list is a snapshot by nature, so this asks that the union of every such
// migration covers the catalog: a fifteenth name without its migration is red here, not in a
