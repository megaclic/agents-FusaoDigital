// Every refusal in `src` that pairs a LITERAL message with a catalog key, as key -> the set of

//
// FIVE SPELLINGS, because a refusal is written five ways here and the rule is about the refusal,
// not about the syntax. The class alternation is DERIVED from src/lib/errors.ts rather than spelled
// out. A hard-coded list goes stale the day someone adds a subclass, and it did: `ConflictError`
// was missing, so every refusal thrown through it (`chatwootDifferentDeployment` among them) was
// invisible. Every spelling since was found the same way, one blind spot at a time, and each was
// MEASURED before being added, because a widened reader is only worth what it newly sees:
//
//   1. `new AppError("…", 400, "errors.x")`, the direct throw;
//   2. `super("…", 400, "errors.x")`, a subclass that hard-codes its own refusal. Sees three keys
//      the direct form does not (`tenantNotFound`, `promptTooLong`, `settingsTextTooLong`), and
//      names no new offender: measured, and the reason it costs nothing to keep looking;
//   3. `{ message: "…", key: "errors.x", params: {…} }`, a refusal BUILT and thrown elsewhere, the
//      shape `src/modules/documents/templates.ts` uses so a dry run and an apply can reach the same
//      answer. This one was hiding a live offender: `invalidDocumentSlug` interpolates the rule the
//      identifier broke (`slug: ${problem}.`) into a catalog entry that says only "This identifier
//      is not valid", and issue #291 was written from a list that could not see it;
//   4. `translate("errors.x", "…")` and 5. `translateWithLocale(locale, "errors.x", "…")`, which are
//      not throws at all: the auth, admin and origin surfaces answer `set.status` plus a body, and
//      the schema boundary renders its own. Twenty-one keys, and the whole of `features/auth` and
//      `features/admin`, had never been read by this rule (issue #299).
//
// THE KEY COMES FIRST in 4 and 5 and second in 1 to 3, which is why the groups are NAMED. Written
// positionally, the two orders are one transposition apart, and the transposed version still runs:
// it reads a message as a key and reports offenders that do not exist.
//
// The `translate(` forms are anchored to the CALL and not to adjacency, and that is the whole
// difference between this reader and a wrong one. Measured while writing it: a bare
// `"errors.x"\s*,\s*"…"` also matches a key sitting next to its neighbour in an ARRAY of keys
// (`src/graph/tools/documents.ts` holds one), and it reported `documentNotStored` and
// `documentRevoked` as offenders whose "message" was the next key in the list.
// The pieces every producer spelling is built from, at module scope so the two readers below cannot
// drift apart on what a key, a status or a literal looks like. MESSAGE is the literal one: a plain
// string or a template, which is what the say-less rule can compare to a catalog entry.
// THE STATUS ARGUMENT IS AN EXPRESSION, not always a literal. This read `\d+` until issue #292,
// and the two OAuth token helpers answer `json.error === "invalid_grant" ? 400 : 502` — so the
// reader walked past both of them and counted their key as having one producer fewer than it has.
// Splitting those keys without seeing it would have left the third producer behind, answering the
// sentence written for another fact.
//
// MEASURED IN BOTH DIRECTIONS, which is the half that is easy to skip: a widened reader is judged
// by what it newly sees, and a matcher that runs too far does not merely see more — it pairs a
// message with somebody else's key and DROPS the right pairing, which shows up as a loss, not as a
// gain. Against this tree: 233 pairs before, 235 after, zero lost, and the two gained are exactly
// the two helpers above.
//
// BOUNDED TO ONE ARGUMENT, and not merely to the next comma. A status is a single expression on a
// single line inside one call, so the run may cross neither a parenthesis, a newline nor a
// semicolon. The looser `[^,]*` measures identically on this tree and is a weaker guarantee: after
// a call that passes NO status, it could swallow the key, the `)` and whatever follows, and pair
// that message with a LATER key. Nothing is written that way here today, which is exactly why the
