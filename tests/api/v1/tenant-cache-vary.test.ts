// A sweep, not an example, because the defect it guards is invisible at the line that causes it.
//
// Every route under v1 resolves its tenant from the `X-Tenant-Id` header, and a SUPER_ADMIN's tenant
// exists nowhere else. So a response the browser may STORE is keyed by a URL that does not mention
// the tenant: switch tenants, hit the same URL, and the cache answers with the previous tenant's
// bytes — without the scoped read that fences them ever running. `private` does not help; it only
// keeps shared proxies out, not the one browser that saw both tenants.
//
// The rule is therefore: under v1, a cacheable response declares `Vary: "X-Tenant-Id"`. Stated as a
// sweep so the next byte-serving endpoint gets it for free, rather than as a test of the one route
// that has it today.
