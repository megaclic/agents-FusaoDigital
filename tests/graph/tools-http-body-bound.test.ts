// The other half of an unbounded read, and the one the time bound does not fix: `res.text()`

// Measured on `main` against a local server: 1,438 MiB of resident memory from a single call, three
// seconds in and still climbing.
//
// IN A SUBPROCESS, because the question is about a whole process's memory.
//
// TWO QUANTITIES, and the pair is the point. This test used to assert on RSS alone against a 50 MB
// ceiling, and that ceiling sat INSIDE the noise: fourteen isolated runs on one machine spread from
// 40.5 MB to 57.2 MB, seven of ten over the line, three of four over it under parallel load (#590).
// A red pre-commit on unrelated work is worse than a slow test, because it teaches everyone to pass
// `--no-verify` and the next real failure in this file gets the same shrug.
//
// The header here used to say a heap threshold "would be green with the defect fully present",
// citing a probe that showed 1.4 GiB of RSS against 0.5 MiB of JS heap. That observation is
// reproducible and its conclusion was wrong by one line: `heapUsed` and `heapStats()` report the
// LAST COLLECTION's accounting, and the 300 MB string is external to it until one runs. Read
// without forcing a collection, the defect grows the heap by exactly zero. Force it first and the
// same defect grows `extraMemorySize` by 314.9 MB. Measured both ways, five runs each side:
//
//   quantity (after Bun.gc(true))   cap in place            cap removed       ratio   max/min green
//   rss                             40.40 - 51.31 MB        631.1 - 631.6 MB   12.3x   1.27
//   heapStats().heapSize             1.493 -  1.502 MB      315.014 MB        210x    1.0058
//   heapStats().extraMemorySize      1.36205 - 1.36210 MB   314.876 MB        231x    1.00003
//
// So RSS stays, with a ceiling that clears the noise by a factor of three, because it is the
// quantity that matches the harm (the process dies); and `extraMemorySize` is added with a tight
// one, because it is the quantity that separates. A defect has to beat both.
//
// NEITHER IS REDUNDANT, and this is the part to read before deleting one of them. The tight
// quantity measures what is still HELD when the collection runs, not what was allocated on the way
// there. A mutation that buffers the whole body and then materialises the prefix, so the big string
// is collectable by the time anything is read, puts `extraMemorySize` back at 1.01 MB — green — and
// 632 MB in RSS. The process still dies; only RSS sees it.
//
// And the reason the literal defect IS caught by the tight one is a runtime detail, not a law:
// `clipText` ends in `value.slice(0, max)`, and a JSC substring retains its parent buffer. The day
// that slice materialises, `extraMemorySize` goes green with the #464 defect fully present and RSS
// is what is left. The precise assertion is the one that leans on someone else's implementation.
