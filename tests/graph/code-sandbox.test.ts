  // asserted how fast this machine is, and both kept the shard red (#518). The first spent 250 ms of
  // a fixed 300 ms budget and then built 60k objects: it passed on a laptop and failed on every CI
  // runner, deterministically. The second measured the build and set the deadline just past it --
  // better, because it no longer wrote the machine down, but it still asked the SECOND run to finish
  // the same build within 1.5x of what the FIRST one took, and one scheduler preemption on a shared
  // runner is wider than that margin (measured here: the build varies 1.2x over 25 runs, and the
  // whole margin is ~12 ms).
  //
  // So the body no longer races its own budget. It builds the value with the budget wide open, then
  // SPINS on `Date.now()` until a chosen instant, which puts the end of the body at a wall-clock
  // point that does not move with how fast the build was. A stall during the build is absorbed
  // whole, because the spin targets an absolute instant and not a duration.
  //
  // WHAT IS LEFT WHEN THE BODY RETURNS IS MEASURED, ON THIS MACHINE, FROM THE REPLY. One quantity
  // decides the whole test: the span between the deadline starting in `open()` and the snippet's
  // first statement -- call it the setup. Ask for a leftover below it and the BODY is interrupted;
  // ask for one above `setup + render` and the render fits anyway and the renewal guards nothing.
  // Four review rounds each found a different contaminant in a host-side ESTIMATE of that span
  // (worker startup, dispatch, result transfer, per-call jitter, disposal after the render), because
  // `wall - ms` is not the setup and no correction term turns it into one.
  //
  // It does not have to be estimated. On a run that came back at all, `ms` covers the setup plus the
  // body, and the body ends at an instant this test chose, so the setup falls straight out of the
  // reply:
  //
  //     setupMs = leftMs - (budgetMs - ms)
  //
  // A calibration run with a leftover nothing could exhaust reads it off; the run that is asserted
  // on then asks for that plus a sliver. A machine three times slower measures three times more and
  // asks for three times more, and no constant written here has to cover it. `ms` starts marginally
  // before the deadline does, which the assertion at the end handles by bounding the leftover from
  // the other side.
