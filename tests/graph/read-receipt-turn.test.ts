// First, that a turn actually acknowledges the message it is answering. The receipt lives in

// the debounce flush too — and the flush's own contribution (the WHOLE burst, not just the newest
// id) is asserted separately below.

// Second, and this is the one that decides whether the feature is safe to ship: an instance whose
// Chatwoot predates the `read_receipt` endpoint answers 401 (its bot allowlist has no such action)
// or 404 (no route at all), and the turn must go through anyway. Every fazer.ai agents deployment
// talks to a Chatwoot the operator upgrades on their own schedule, so this is the ordinary case for
// a while, not an edge one.
