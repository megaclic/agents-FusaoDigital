// Issue #161. A tool description is paid for by every client on every session, before it knows
// whether the tool will be used at all, and `agent_settings_set` had become the place every settings
// block appended a paragraph to: 6,107 characters, 23% of all description text across 95 tools, 4.9x
// the runner-up and 36x the median. The norm it is now held to is written down in docs/mcp.md.
//
// The two assertions below are deliberately different in kind. The ceiling is a RATCHET, not a style
// rule: it exists because the growth was monotonic and invisible, and its job is to make the next
// append a decision rather than a reflex. Raising it is a legitimate outcome of that decision — what
// is not legitimate is not noticing. The second asserts what must SURVIVE a trim, because a ceiling
// on its own invites cutting whatever is easiest rather than whatever is cheapest.

// NOTE: headroom over the current 1,931 for an ordinary edit, the same slack the 3,800 carried over

// went into the prose is only the half a caller cannot read off the schema (a summariser override
// that is stored without complaint and then never runs), and 69 characters of remaining headroom is
// the ratchet doing its job, not a number to relieve. The next append here is a decision. What was 6,107 before #161 and 3,534 after it came down again when #174 moved every field
// name, choice and range into the schema; what is left is the rules a caller cannot read off either
// the schema or docs/ — the ones that REFUSE a call, and the ones the write accepts and the runtime
// then never acts on.
// RAISED from 2,000 for the Z-PRO fork's own settings-schema sync: `zproCrm` (a Z-PRO-only block,
// no Chatwoot equivalent) needed one sentence saying so, and the docs/ pointer list gained
// `contact-auth, zpro`. 98 characters, all pointing a caller at where the fact actually lives
// rather than restating it here.
const SETTINGS_DESC_CEILING = 2_110;

// NOTE: the ratchet has to follow the content. A ceiling on the description alone would have watched
// the half that shrank while the shape it moved into grew unwatched — `tools/list` ships both, and a
// client pays for both before it knows whether the tool will be used. Headroom over the current
// 9,711 is deliberately tighter than a whole block (~600 characters), so the next block declaring
// its fields here is a decision rather than a reflex.
//
// RAISED from 10,200 for issue #142, and the raise is the decision the ceiling exists to force. The
// `memory.compaction` block gained the summariser's own model override — the same quartet tts
// carries for its rewrite — and it costs 524 characters, near enough a whole block. Most of that is
// the provider ENUM, which is the one part worth publishing: it is the list a client renders. The
// only discretionary 72 in it is the `null inherits the agent's` note on that enum, and trimming it
// to fit under 10,200 was the available move and the wrong one — null is the whole semantics of the
// override, and cutting the sentence that explains it is cutting what is easiest rather than what is
// cheapest. Headroom over 10,235 stays tighter than a block, as before.
//
// RAISED from 10,600 for issue #182, and again the raise is the decision the ceiling forces. The
// `contactAuth` block declares nine fields and costs 1,068 characters, above a whole block, and
// trimming it to fit was tried first: it bought 92. What is left is not padding. Three of the nine
// carry a note a caller cannot get by trying, and each names a way the block fails SILENTLY.
// `noticeCooldownSeconds` reads as a verdict cache to anyone who has met one, and a caller who
// believes it is caching sets it high and thinks revocation is instant when it is not.
// `includeMessageText` is read as false under GET, so the unlock flow is configured, stored,
// and never runs. `denyMessage: null` means say nothing, which is a refusal the customer sees no
// sign of. The rest is the shape: nine fields, an enum and the nullable wrappers, and that part
// does not compress. Headroom over 11,303 stays tighter than a block, as before.
// RAISED from 11,650 for the Z-PRO fork's own settings-schema sync (upstream's #174 typed-schema
// refactor did not know about the fork's Z-PRO-only fields): `handoff.targetQueueId` (the pinned
// Z-PRO queue target) and `channelRedirect.entryZproInstanceId` (the Z-PRO entry channel) each
// needed one field on an existing block, and `zproCrm` needed a whole new one (`pipelineId` +
// `instructions`). None of the three has a Chatwoot equivalent to fold into, so none compresses.
