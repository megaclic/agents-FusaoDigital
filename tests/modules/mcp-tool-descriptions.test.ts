// NOTE: headroom over the current 1,931 for an ordinary edit, the same slack the 3,800 carried over
// 3,534. Issue #142 spent 166 of that slack and the ceiling is deliberately NOT moving for it: what
// went into the prose is only the half a caller cannot read off the schema (a summariser override
// that is stored without complaint and then never runs), and 69 characters of remaining headroom is
// the ratchet doing its job, not a number to relieve. The next append here is a decision. What was 6,107 before #161 and 3,534 after it came down again when #174 moved every field
// name, choice and range into the schema; what is left is the rules a caller cannot read off either
// the schema or docs/ — the ones that REFUSE a call, and the ones the write accepts and the runtime
// then never acts on.
// RAISED from 2,000 for the Z-PRO fork's own settings-schema sync: `zproCrm` (a Z-PRO-only block,
// no Chatwoot equivalent) needed one sentence saying so, and the docs/ pointer list gained
// `contact-auth, zpro`. 98 characters, all pointing a caller at where the fact actually lives
// rather than restating it here.
const SETTINGS_DESC_CEILING = 2_110;

// NOTE: the ratchet has to follow the content. A ceiling on the description alone would have watched
// the half that shrank while the shape it moved into grew unwatched — `tools/list` ships both, and a
// client pays for both before it knows whether the tool will be used. Headroom over the current
// 9,711 is deliberately tighter than a whole block (~600 characters), so the next block declaring
// its fields here is a decision rather than a reflex.
//
// RAISED from 10,200 for issue #142, and the raise is the decision the ceiling exists to force. The
// `memory.compaction` block gained the summariser's own model override — the same quartet tts
// carries for its rewrite — and it costs 524 characters, near enough a whole block. Most of that is
// the provider ENUM, which is the one part worth publishing: it is the list a client renders. The
// only discretionary 72 in it is the `null inherits the agent's` note on that enum, and trimming it
// to fit under 10,200 was the available move and the wrong one — null is the whole semantics of the
// override, and cutting the sentence that explains it is cutting what is easiest rather than what is
// cheapest. Headroom over 10,235 stays tighter than a block, as before.
//
// RAISED from 10,600 for issue #182, and again the raise is the decision the ceiling forces. The
// `contactAuth` block declares nine fields and costs 1,068 characters, above a whole block, and
// trimming it to fit was tried first: it bought 92. What is left is not padding. Three of the nine
// carry a note a caller cannot get by trying, and each names a way the block fails SILENTLY.
// `noticeCooldownSeconds` reads as a verdict cache to anyone who has met one, and a caller who
// believes it is caching sets it high and thinks revocation is instant when it is not.
// `includeMessageText` is read as false under GET, so the unlock flow is configured, stored,
// and never runs. `denyMessage: null` means say nothing, which is a refusal the customer sees no
// sign of. The rest is the shape: nine fields, an enum and the nullable wrappers, and that part
// does not compress. Headroom over 11,303 stays tighter than a block, as before.
//
// RAISED from 11,650 for issue #58, and this time the trim came first and bought most of it. The
// `observability` block gained one field, `fullDetailUntil`, and typing it as `z.iso.datetime()`
// published a 430-character regex — a third of a whole block's budget spent restating a format the
// description states in four words. Declaring it a plain string moved the check into a `refine`,
// which publishes nothing, and gave back 351 of the 738 the field had cost. What is left is the
// field name, the nullable wrapper, and one sentence a caller cannot get by trying: that the value
// is the instant the mode ENDS rather than a duration or a switch, and that the mode stores log
// detail whole instead of cutting it at 2,000. Headroom over 11,690 stays tighter than a block, as
// before.
//
// RAISED from 12,050 for issue #143, and the trim was measured BEFORE the raise rather than after.
// The `modelFallback` block declares the same quartet the two other model overrides carry and costs
// 657 characters; dropping BOTH its `describe` notes buys 130 and still does not fit. So the raise
// is not avoidable by trimming, and trimming would only delete the half a caller cannot get by
// trying: a fallback needs a provider AND a model, and naming one of the two stores a block that
// reads as configured and can never run — the same silent-failure shape every raise above paid for.
// The remaining 527 is the shape (four fields, the provider enum, the nullable wrappers) and does
// not compress. Headroom over 12,347 stays tighter than a block, as before.
//
// RAISED from 12,400 for issue #103, and the trim was measured first, against the 53 characters
// #143 left. `ignoreAppointmentPause` on a follow-up step costs 201 with the note it was written
// with; rewriting the note to its shortest honest form buys 48 and lands at 153, which still does
// not fit. Dropping the note entirely WOULD fit, and that is precisely the trade every raise above
// refuses: what it says is the one thing a caller cannot get by trying, because the flag is INERT
// unless `followUp.pauseWhileAppointment` is on. Without it a caller exempts a step, stores a block
// that reads as configured, and nothing about that step ever fires differently — the same
// silent-failure shape as `includeMessageText` and the half-named `modelFallback` above. The
// remaining 153 is the field name, the boolean, and that sentence. Headroom over 12,500 stays
// tighter than a block, as before.
//
// RAISED from 12,550 for issue #189, which adds `contactAuth.mode` and `contactAuth.grantTtlSeconds`
// at 314 characters together. Re-measured on this tree at 12,864, not added to the previous figure:
// the base moved while this branch was open, and a sum assumes nothing else did. What the two
// `.describe()` strings buy is the pair of facts a caller cannot get by trying — that `once` stops
// asking until the verdict EXPIRES (a caller who assumes otherwise ships a gate that has stopped
// consulting them), and what the TTL is part of, since it looks like a harmless number.
//
// The figure was re-measured at the END of that issue's review loop rather than left at the one
// taken when it opened: the two `.describe()` strings were rewritten twice while the loop ran, and
// the number they landed on is 12,942 — eight characters under the ceiling the first measurement
// justified, which is not headroom, it is a coin flip on the next edit. Tighter than a block, and
// not tighter than a sentence.
// #402 raises this the most any single change has: 12,550 → 20,900, measured at 20,443. Four blocks
// of the settings bag reached MCP for the first time (guardrails, kanban, toolGuidance,
// toolPreconditions), and two of them are maps keyed by the native tool catalog, so their value is
// published once per tool name — thirteen times each.
//
// The figure is a RE-MEASUREMENT after review, not the branch's first one, and it moved twice more
// before it settled. It read 20,839 while `appointmentReminders` was published too; that block
// turned out not to be an agent-settings block at all (its reader is only ever handed the Google
// Calendar instance's config), so it was removed rather than paid for, taking it to 20,443. Then
// review found the text caps missing from the new blocks' descriptions — a caller cannot build a
// valid call from tools/list without failing first — and publishing them cost 552 characters, to
// 20,995. A later round added the guidance PRECEDENCE sentence (handoff/kanban notes live in their
// own block and win there), taking it to 21,108, and a later one the input direction's template
// fallback for `generated` (accepted, as the console offers it, but it never generates), taking it
// to 21,216. A last round declared what the readers DISCARD rather than honor: every field read
// through `readToolInstructions` (handoff.instructions, kanban.instructions, and toolGuidance's
// value, so thirteen times over) now publishes `pattern: "\\S"`, refusing a note that trims to
// nothing instead of accepting one the runtime never appends. That is 272 characters, to 21,488.
// Every figure here is one measured under the tree that ships; adding deltas would have left a
// ceiling calibrated against trees that never did.
//
// Paid down before it was raised, and only where it cost the caller nothing: the per-field
// `.describe()` on the two name-keyed blocks moved to the BLOCK, since a field description inside a
// thirteen-times-repeated value is published thirteen times. That was 22,807 → 20,839, and the text
// a caller reads is unchanged.
//
// What was measured and REJECTED, so the next person does not re-derive it: `z.record(z.enum(...))`
// publishes the value once and would have cost ~1 KB instead of 3.9 KB. It refuses an unrecognized
// key with `Unrecognized key: "<what the caller sent>"` in the message — the caller's own string in
// a refusal, which is the exact hazard tests/api/v1/write-body-required.test.ts exists to keep out
// of this codebase. The thirteen copies are what buys a refusal that can only name what the SERVER
// declared.
//
// MERGED, and re-measured once more on the tree that came out of it. Both sides above raised this
// same constant from 12,550 while the other was open, so the two figures are about two trees that
// no longer exist: summing them would write 21,880, a number measured nowhere. The tree that ships
// is measured at 21,930. A round after it, the same declare-what-the-server-enforces rule reached
// the precondition's own strings: `key` and `equals` are trimmed by `parseToolPrecondition` and
// REFUSED by the write boundary, so a schema-valid call came back as an error with nothing published
// to predict it. Two more patterns, published thirteen times each, at 22,346.
//
// RAISED again for this fork's own Z-PRO settings-schema sync on top of the tree above (the fork's
// prior baseline, before this merge, was 12,350: see the git history of this constant):
// `handoff.targetQueueId` (the pinned Z-PRO queue target) and `channelRedirect.entryZproInstanceId`
// (the Z-PRO entry channel) each add one field on an existing block, and `zproCrm` adds a whole new
// block (`pipelineId` + `instructions`). None of the three has a Chatwoot equivalent to fold into,
// so none compresses. Measured on the merged tree at 24,396.

  // schema. The headroom below is deliberately smaller than one substantial tool, so the next

  // noticing is not.
  //
  // The schema figure was 38,379 when this test was written and the cap 39,500. It moved because the
  // `contactAuth` block landed on the base while this branch was open, costing 1,347 characters of
  // agent_settings_set — the same addition that raised SETTINGS_SCHEMA_CEILING above. Re-measured
  // rather than trimmed: nothing here grew, the total simply now includes a block that was not in it
  // when the number was taken, and cutting a document description to fit an unrelated arrival is
  // cutting what is easiest rather than what is cheapest.
  //
  // The description figure moved again for issue #305, which added three tools (delivery list, get
  // and requeue) at 748 characters against 467 of headroom. Raised deliberately, and only after the
  // two that could be trimmed without costing the model anything were: `_get` stopped restating the
  // field list that `_list` publishes one line above it. The delivery ledger is a surface an
  // operator agent needs to be able to find, so the alternative here was not a smaller number, it
  // was a tool nobody can call. The schema figure moved with it, by 345: most of that is
  // `webhook_delivery_list`, whose seven filters and four-value status enum are the whole point of
  // a dead-letter view, and the enum is derived from the module's vocabulary rather than hand-typed
  // (see the note at its registration) so shrinking it here would mean advertising fewer statuses
  // than the surface accepts.
  // Issue #143 moves the SCHEMA figure and not the description one: `agent_settings_set` is the only
  // tool the `modelFallback` block reaches, and a block publishes fields, not prose. Re-measured
  // rather than trimmed, for the reason the paragraph above gives — the alternative is cutting an
  // unrelated document description to pay for it.
  //
  // The two arrived together on the way to the merge, so these figures are a FRESH measurement of
  // the combined tree rather than either branch's number: adding the two deltas would assume nothing
  // else moved between them, and it does not survive the measurement. Measured here: 26,764 of
  // description and 41,852 of schema. The DESCRIPTION ceiling therefore does NOT move for #143 —
  // this block publishes a schema and no new tool, so #305's number still has room and raising it
  // would have been a number nobody had measured. The schema ceiling does, to 41,950.
  //
  // #103 moves the schema figure again and not the description one, for the same reason: the
  // follow-up step gains one boolean and its note, and no tool is added. Measured at 42,027 of
  // schema after the trim documented at SETTINGS_SCHEMA_CEILING, so the ceiling goes to 42,100.
  //
  // #189 moves the schema figure and not the description one, again for the same reason: two fields
  // on the `contactAuth` block, no new tool. FRESH measurement of this tree — 26,764 of description
  // and 42,419 of schema — rather than 42,100 plus the 314 those fields cost on
  // `agent_settings_set`: the base gained tools while this branch was open, and adding deltas writes
  // a number nobody measured. The description ceiling does not move.
  //
  // Re-measured at the END of that loop, for the reason at SETTINGS_SCHEMA_CEILING: 26,764 of
  // description and 42,497 of schema, which is three characters under the ceiling the first
  // measurement justified. Schema ceiling to 42,600.
  // #402 moves the SCHEMA figure and not the description one, and it is the largest single move so
  // far: measured at 49,998, so the ceiling goes to 50,500. No tool was added — four blocks of the
  // settings bag became reachable through MCP at all, which is why the whole cost lands on schema.
  // Re-measured on the combined tree rather than added to the previous figure, and re-measured a
  // SECOND time after review removed `appointmentReminders` from the change (50,394 → 49,998), for
  // the same reason: a ceiling is only worth what someone actually measured under it.
  //
  // Two later rounds of the same PR moved it again, and the first of them moved the NUMBER without
  // moving this paragraph — which is the failure this whole comment exists to prevent, so it is
  // recorded rather than quietly overwritten: the ceiling read 50,900 with nothing here saying what
  // had been measured under it. Re-measured on the tree that ships, the figure is 51,043, and the
  // ceiling goes to 51,300. The last increment is the blank-note refusal documented at
  // SETTINGS_SCHEMA_CEILING; the rest predates it and is now folded into a figure someone measured.
  //
  // Worth stating plainly, because this test exists to make it a decision rather than a surprise:
  // the payload is now ~50 KB of schema plus ~27 KB of description across 107 tools, published in
  // full on every tools/list before a client knows whether any of it will be used. Nothing here is
  // waste in itself — every block a client cannot see is a block it cannot configure — but the
  // TOTAL is now the thing worth an issue of its own, and the answer at that size is load-on-demand
  // schemas rather than a smaller vocabulary. Splitting one tool into several is the intuitive move
  // and the wrong one: the per-tool envelope is then paid more times, not fewer.
  //
  // And re-measured after the merge of the two, for the reason above: the branch figure (51,043) and
  // the base figure (42,497) are each about a tree the other had not landed on. The merged tree is
  // 51,485 of schema and 26,764 of description. The precondition patterns documented at
  // SETTINGS_SCHEMA_CEILING then took the schema to 51,901; the ceiling goes to 52,100.
  //
  // RAISED again for this fork's own Z-PRO settings-schema sync (the same delta SETTINGS_SCHEMA_CEILING
  // took above), which this whole-payload sum was never re-measured against. Measured on the merged
