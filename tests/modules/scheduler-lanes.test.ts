// Issue #165. Two things are asserted here, and they are the two halves of the rule in lanes.ts.
//
// The PARTITION, against the database rather than against the map. The map is the thing under test
// only in the sense that the SQL is derived from it: a test that read `JOB_LANE` and counted would
// be green on a map that is right and a filter that is wrong, which is the shape of every table that
// was never checked against its consumer. So every kind is enqueued for real and every lane claims
// for real, and the assertion is on which lane got which row.
//
// The DRAIN, because "the shared lane is concurrent" is a claim about ordering that no unit test of
// a pure function can make. The handlers below deadlock a serial drain on purpose: the first job
// cannot finish until the second one starts. Serially that is a hang; concurrently it is a pass.
//
// Both tests fence on this file's tenant. The claim is cross-tenant by design, so a second DB-backed
// suite running at the same time is not a hypothetical: its rows fill the batch, and a deadlock test
// whose pair never got claimed together times out exactly like a serial drain would.
