// The console's action filter offers a list, and the list is a constant rather than a query (see the
// note on AUDIT_ACTIONS for why). A constant is only worth offering while it agrees with the code
// that writes the rows, and it can disagree in two directions that fail differently:
//
//   MISSING — a family adds `channel.foo` and the operator cannot pick it. The trail holds rows
//   nobody can filter to, which is the failure the filter exists to prevent.
//   EXTRA — a producer is deleted or renamed and its name stays on the list. The operator picks a
//   value that can never match and reads the empty page as "nothing happened".
//
// Both are asserted, and the sweep counts through `tests/utils/source-text` so a name that only
// appears in PROSE — every one of these modules explains its own actions in comments — is not read
// as a producer.
//
// `withoutComments` and NOT `codeOnly`: the thing being looked for IS a string literal, so blanking
// string bodies blanks the answer. Measured — the first version of this file used `codeOnly` and
// counted zero producers, which without the floor below would have read as a clean tree.
// The value expression written after `action:`, up to the comma or brace that ends the property.
//
// NOT a `action:\s*"([a-z_]+\.[a-z_]+)"` match, which is what this file did first and which reads
// only the simplest producer. `setCompanyLogoKey` writes
//
//   action: logoKey === null ? "company_logo.clear" : "company_logo.set",
//
// and a literal-initializer pattern sees neither name — so both were missing from the vocabulary
// while this test was green, which is exactly the direction that leaves an action unfilterable.
// Review found it. Reading the whole expression finds every literal in any shape of it.
//
// Depth-aware and string-aware, because the value can contain a nested call, an object, or a comma
// inside a template. A producer that computes its name from a variable contributes nothing, which is
// the one gap left and is visible: the entry it needs would show up as `extra` on the list.
