// A write tool with `dry_run` answers its preview WITHOUT touching the core, and that shortcut is
// what makes the preview cheap. It is also what makes every rule the core learns start out
// unmirrored: the preview keeps answering `ok`, nobody notices, and the operator (or the model
// driving MCP) reads a confident description of a write that cannot happen. Issue #490.
//
// Two things this harness learned the hard way, both worth keeping written down. It does NOT drive
// the tools through the MCP client, tempting as that is: the server's handlers use `basePrisma`,
// built at import time off `DATABASE_URL`, which `tests/setup.ts` deliberately points at a dead
// database — so every apply "refused" with `Database 'test' does not exist` and eleven tools looked
// broken that were not. And a refusal is not any failure: a thrown Prisma error is a CRASH, and
// counting it as a refusal is what made that contamination invisible. `verdict` below separates the
// three outcomes and the rows fail loudly on the third.
//
// The fence has two halves and needs both. The TABLE below gives every dry-run tool one input the
// APPLY refuses; the first test derives the tool list from the live registry and fails when a tool
// has no row, so a tool added later cannot join silently. The second drives both halves of each row
// and requires them to agree — and requires the apply to have actually refused, because a row whose
// apply succeeds proves nothing and would quietly become decoration.

const NOPE = "999999999";

// `skip` states, in writing, why a tool has no refusable input reachable from its arguments alone.
// It is not an escape hatch for a row that is merely awkward: the reason has to be a property of the
// tool, and the fence prints it.
type Case = { args: Record<string, unknown>; why: string };
// `also` carries the inputs a one-row-per-tool table cannot: a tool agrees on the row's input and
// still diverges on another, and each of these was a real second divergence found after the row for
// that tool was already green.
//
// `pastOwnership` is the OTHER thing a row cannot say. Forty-two of these pass `NOPE` — an id that
// names no row — so what they prove is the ownership check and nothing the core decides once it HAS
// the row. That is not a defect of the row (a not-found is a real refusal and worth pinning); it is
// a limit, and an invisible one, because the row reads as covering its tool. So every row shaped
// that way carries what was measured on a row that EXISTS, and the test below refuses a new one
// without it — which is the part that keeps this from happening again (#510).

// ── The class the TABLE cannot reach at all: a row that passes an id NAMING NOTHING ──────────────
//
// Forty-two of the sixty-six rows above pass `NOPE` as their target's id. Those rows prove the
// ownership check and stop there: every rule the core applies once it HAS the row goes unasked, and
// the row stays green while the preview approves a write the apply refuses. Issue #510, and the
// measurement is the deliverable — each tool was driven on a row that EXISTS, with an input its core
// refuses, and the twelve below are the ones that diverged. What was measured and did NOT diverge is
// written on the row itself (`pastOwnership`), so the next reader does not re-derive it.
//
// The controls matter as much as the divergences here. Every fix in this block makes a preview say
// no more often, and "refuse everything" passes a coherence test — so each rule that has an
// inverse (a document that IS retryable, a tool keeping its own name) is pinned in both directions.
