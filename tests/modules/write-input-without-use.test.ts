// Three write families accepted input their own domain cannot use, and each rule already existed
// somewhere else: on the REST transport (a knowledge base's name is `minLength: 1` there, an
// experiment's is 1-200) or in the runtime that reads the row back (a `urlTemplate` the tool call
// feeds to `new URL`, an `agentId` the variant resolver looks up). The core never asked, so the MCP
// road walked past all of them and the row landed. Issue #501.
//
// What each test pins is the EFFECT first and the refusal second, because a bound with no effect
// behind it is a number someone will relax later. The effects are measured on the base commit:
//
//   - a base whose name is blank is dropped from `search_knowledge`'s scope list (buildRagTools
//     filters on `name.trim()`), which also collapses the `knowledge_base` parameter for every
//     OTHER base the agent has;
//   - a 5000-character name goes whole into that tool's description on every turn, and evicts the
//     other bases from the 1000-character budget the file keeps precisely so "a verbose KB never
//     bloats the prompt";
//   - a `url_template` that is not a URL builds a tool, grants it, offers it to the model and
//     THROWS on the first call (`tool X: invalid urlTemplate`, 400) — not a ToolFailure the model
//     can read, a raw AppError;
//   - an experiment on an id that names no agent overrides nothing, forever.
