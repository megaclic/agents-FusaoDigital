// A console form can only send back what the read gave it, so the read projection decides what a
// save is allowed to preserve (issue #435). The alert-channel editor PATCHes its WHOLE form on every
// save and the service reads a null `secretRef` as "clear it", so a field the read never returned is
// not merely uneditable: it is erased by the next save of an operator who opened the dialog to
// rename the channel.
//
// The tests drive the round trip a whole-body client performs — list, build the body from what was
// listed, PATCH — rather than asserting the DTO has a field, because the field is only worth having
// if it survives that trip. On the base the list has no `secretRef` to hand back and the channel
// comes out unsigned.
//
// The console itself now OMITS the key when the operator did not touch the picker, which is a second
// and stronger guarantee: it does not require the stored value to be re-writable, and before #126
// this column accepted any string at all, so plenty of stored values are not. The last test here is
// that fact, measured. The whole-body shape stays covered because REST callers still use it.
