// Round 29. An agent import takes the tenant's tool-name lock ONCE, before it touches any tool row
// (createMissingComponents in modules/agents/transfer.ts), and then reads and writes rows under it.
// Every other path that takes both locks has to take them in that order, or the two deadlock: the
// update holds the row and waits for the namespace while the import holds the namespace and waits
// for the row. Postgres notices and kills one of them, so the operator loses a whole import to a
// concurrent save of an unrelated tool.
//
// A SOURCE fence, and deliberately so. Reproducing the deadlock needs two transactions interleaved
// at a specific instant, which is a flaky test; what actually has to hold is a property of the code
// -- one statement precedes another -- and that is what is read here. The failure this catches is
// someone adding a row lock above the namespace lock, which reads as harmless in a diff.
