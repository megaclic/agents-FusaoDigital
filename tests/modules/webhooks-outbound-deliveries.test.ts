// ── THE DELIVERY LEDGER AS A SUPPORTED SURFACE (issue #305) ──
// Integration, real DB, real RLS: every call goes through `runScopedOn` exactly as the controller
// and the MCP tools reach it, so a cross-tenant read fails here the way it would in production
// rather than the way a mocked client would let it.
//
// The effect asserted for the requeue is never the returned DTO alone: a requeue that does not put
// the row where the WORKER will pick it up is a status change and nothing more. So the worker runs
// for real (claim, backoff, outcome) and the assertion is that the receiver was posted to.
