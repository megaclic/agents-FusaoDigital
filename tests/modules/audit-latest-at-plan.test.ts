// `latestAt` IN CONSTANT TIME ON ALL THREE TRAILS (#520, review round 1).
//
// Every audit read reports the newest row of its trail past any filter, so this aggregate runs on
// every page and every filtered request. The tenant trail was already constant: RLS supplies
// `tenant_id = …`, which is the leading column of `audit_logs_tenant_id_created_at_idx`, so Postgres
// rewrites `max(created_at)` into a one-row backward walk of it. Neither scope this PR added can use
// that index the same way -- `scope=all` constrains nothing and `scope=fleet` constrains the leading
// column to NULL, which is indexable but carries no ordering pathkey -- so both degraded into a scan
// of the whole trail. Measured on 500k rows (40 tenants, 12.5k keyed to no tenant), PG 17.10:
//
//   scope=tenant     7 buffers    0.046 ms   Limit + Index Only Scan Backward
//   scope=fleet   5720 buffers    5.6  ms    Bitmap Heap Scan, 12,500 rows read to keep one
//   scope=all     5669 buffers   18.9  ms    Parallel Seq Scan, 500,000 rows read to keep one
//
// and after the migration, 3 and 4 buffers. So the assertion here is the SHAPE of the plan, not a
// duration: a `Limit` under the aggregate is the rewrite itself, and it is exactly what an index
// unusable for the ordering cannot produce. `enable_seqscan = off` keeps the answer about the index
// rather than about the planner's cost choice on a test table that holds a handful of rows -- the
// same reason `rls-policy-shape.test.ts` sets it.
//
// The negative half runs in the SAME transaction, with the indexes dropped and rolled back, because
// a plan assertion that has never been seen to fail proves nothing about the index it names: without
// them the very same query falls back to `Aggregate` over a `Bitmap Heap Scan`, which is the linear
// shape this migration exists to remove.
