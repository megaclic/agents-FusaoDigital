// Who is allowed to read a vault secret RAW, and who has to go through a resolver that answers for
// the pairing. Issue #471.
//
// `tryResolveVaultEntry` hands back `secret: unknown` plus the entry's `kind`, and answering "can
// this serve my field?" from those two is the caller's job. Eight call sites got that wrong the same
// way (they wrote `<string>` and used it), so the compiler now refuses the assertion — but a caller
// can still narrow with a bare `typeof x === "string"`, which passes `mcp_env`: a real string the
// catalog says must never leave this process. That is the hole a type cannot close, and this is the
// fence over it.
//
// The rule: a module that sends a secret to somebody else's endpoint resolves it through
// `tryResolveApiKeyEntry` (a plain key) or `resolveInjectableCredential*` (a key or a refreshed OAuth
// token). Everything else is listed here with the reason it reads the entry directly.

const RAW_READER = "tryResolveVaultEntry";

// path → why this module reads the entry directly instead of through a use-aware resolver.
