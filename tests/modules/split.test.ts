// ── Partial delivery (issue #429) ────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// A split reply is N sends with a typing pause between them, so a transient Chatwoot failure has N-1
// windows to land INSIDE the reply — and the window is as wide as the reply is long, because
// `typingDelayMs` is deliberately proportional to the chunk. What that leaves is not a failed send:
// it is a customer holding the first half of an answer.
//
// The unit of delivery is the REPLY, not the balloon, and the asymmetry is what a failure costs:
//
//   nothing landed  A real turn failure. Reported as `failed` with `delivered: 0` so the caller
//                   throws, the operator is told, and the recovery (#295) re-runs the turn — safe
//                   precisely because the customer received nothing to duplicate.
//   something landed  Never a throw. Throwing discards `delivered` (the count that exists to say
//                   what the customer received) and hands the whole reply back to the recovery,
//                   which re-runs the turn and sends the balloons that already landed a second time.
//
// The remainder is retried ONCE, consolidated into a single send, which is the same rule read from
// the customer's side: they get the whole answer instead of a truncated one, and no balloon that
// already arrived is sent again. Per-chunk durable state would be the alternative and buys nothing
// here — the chunks are still in memory in this very process.
