// THE EFFECT THE ISSUE NAMES: the stage line is not there.
//
// `execution_logs.detail` is a `jsonb` column, and Postgres refuses an unpaired surrogate inside one
// outright ("Unicode low surrogate must follow a high surrogate", SQLSTATE 22P02). `emitFlowEvent` is
// fire-and-forget with a catch, so the refusal never reaches the turn: the write is dropped, a warn
// goes to the process log, and the line the operator later goes looking for simply does not exist.
//
// Two ways in, and the second is why fixing the cut alone would not have been enough:
//   1. a `detail` string long enough to be truncated, cut between the halves of an emoji;
//   2. a `detail` string that ALREADY holds an orphan half, no truncation involved — any JSON source
//      that spells one out (`"\ud800"`) hands `JSON.parse` one directly, which is an ordinary thing
//      for an HTTP tool's response body to do.
//
// Asserted at the row, not at the redactor, because "the redactor returns a clean string" is a proxy
// for the thing that was actually broken.
