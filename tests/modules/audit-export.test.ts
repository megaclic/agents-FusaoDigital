// TAKING THE TRAIL OUT OF THE BROWSER (issue #521).
//
// The export answers the question the operator is already looking at, so the thing worth testing is
// not that it produces a CSV -- it is that it produces the SAME ROWS the page does. Hence the shared
// `buildAuditWhere`, and hence the assertions here run the list and the export against one filter and
// compare, rather than restating the expected rows by hand: a test that spells out both sides can go
// on passing while the two readers drift apart, which is the only failure this feature really has.
//
// The scope comes with it, and the issue did not ask for that -- it was written before #520. An
// export that ignored the scope would either dump the wrong trail or repeat the omission #520 closed,
// so `fleet`/`all` are refused to the same callers and read under the same role.
//
// THE CAP IS BYTES AND NOT ONLY ROWS, and that is measured rather than chosen. `truncForAudit` bounds
// each STRING at 4000 but nothing bounds the object, and `agent.prompt_set` writes two prompts: a
// worst-case row serializes to 8,120 bytes of CSV, so the Logs module's 10,000-row cap would permit a
// 77 MB download. A month of ordinary rows (161 bytes measured on a dev trail) still comes out whole;
// the month carrying prompts is the one that cuts.
