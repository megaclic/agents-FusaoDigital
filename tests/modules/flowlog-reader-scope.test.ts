// EVERY TEST THAT READS THE FLOW LOG, AND WHAT SCOPES IT.
//
// `emitFlowEvent` is fire-and-forget by design (src/modules/flowlog/service.ts): the hot WhatsApp
// path must not pay write latency for six log lines. A test that asserts on those lines therefore
// has two obligations, and the readers honoured them unevenly (issue #258).
//
//   SCOPE  a reader filtered only by `tenantId` returns rows of whatever else ran in the file. Every
//          DB-backed test file seeds ONE tenant (`slug: <prefix>-${process.pid}`), so the tenant
//          fences the FILE and nothing inside it: the neighbour a reader answers with is another
//          test of the same file, never another file.
//   WAIT   even a correctly scoped reader can run before the row lands, because nothing awaits the
//          write.
//   CLEAR  a test that EMPTIES the table empties it of the rows that exist. A write the previous case
//          only scheduled lands after the DELETE, into a table this case believes it owns, and
//          `orderBy: { id: "asc" }` hands that row back FIRST (issue #375).
//
// This file guards all three, and the second only since #419. It used to say the second "cannot be
// read off the source", because "is there a wait" is a question about control flow, which was true
// of the wait it had. The wait was a POLL LOOP, and a loop is a shape rather than a name, so there
// was nothing to grep for. The observation underneath it was also right and is worth keeping: a poll
// is only correct when the assertion is that a line EXISTS, since polling for an absence just spends
// the timeout before answering the empty read it opened with.
//
// What changed is not the analysis, it is the wait. `flowLogRows` / `flowLogRow` / `flowLogCount`
// settle the scheduled writes and then read, which makes the obligation checkable the same way the
// third already was: by having ONE SPELLING. It also answers the objection rather than working
// around it, because a settle is exact in both directions where a poll could only do presence.
//
// The argument for spending that is that the comments this obligation was left to did not hold.
// chatwoot-command-dropped.test.ts polled for its `command` row and read its `route` row raw, three
// lines apart, under a comment explaining the hazard for the first one, and the raw read turned CI
// red on a branch touching no server file (#419). An obligation spelled out per site is one a new
// site is written without, which is the reason tests/utils/flowlog.ts gives for the clear helper
// existing at all.
//
// The third is checkable for the same reason: `clearFlowLog` (tests/utils/flowlog.ts) settles the
// scheduled writes and then deletes. A raw DELETE is the defect, so the guard is that there are no
// raw ones rather than a per-site judgement.
//
// WHAT IT DOES NOT COVER, said out loud rather than left to be discovered: 29 files end with a loop
// over a table list, `execution_logs` among the entries and the name interpolated into
// `DELETE FROM ${table}`, so the literal never sits next to the verb and no widening of the pattern
// below reaches it. Those are TEARDOWNS — nothing reads the table after them — so they cannot produce
// the failure this obligation is about. What they can produce is a log line arriving after its tenant
// was deleted, and that was measured on both sides rather than argued: ONE swallowed
// `execution_logs_tenant_id_fkey` per full-suite run, in 8 of 8 runs of the base, and converting all
// 29 loops to a settling helper left it at exactly one. A guard for them would be enforcing a rule
// with no measured effect, so this file does not pretend to have one.
//
// The ledger is per file with a count, following tests/lib/storable-write-sweep.test.ts: a NEW
// reader in an already-listed file trips this too, not only a new file. The classification is the
// point of the ledger. `tenant-wide` is a real answer for a reader whose subject is the TABLE rather
// than one turn's trail, and it is written down so it stays a decision instead of an omission.
//
// NOTE: the price of a ledger over the whole test tree is that ANY branch adding a reader anywhere
// has to touch this file, and it will find out from this test rather than from review. That is the
// intended cost — it is the same trade tests/lib/storable-write-sweep.test.ts makes over `src/` —
// but it has one edge the other does not: an entry in a file the derivation drops from an edition
// would make this red in that edition and green here. Every file listed below survives into both
// today, and a reader added inside a `@full-only` test file is the case to watch for.
