// EVERY TEST THAT READS THE FLOW LOG, AND WHAT SCOPES IT.
//
// `emitFlowEvent` is fire-and-forget by design (src/modules/flowlog/service.ts): the hot WhatsApp
// path must not pay write latency for six log lines. A test that asserts on those lines therefore
// has two obligations, and the readers honoured them unevenly (issue #258).
//
//   SCOPE  a reader filtered only by `tenantId` returns rows of whatever else ran in the file. Every
//          DB-backed test file seeds ONE tenant (`slug: <prefix>-${process.pid}`), so the tenant
//          fences the FILE and nothing inside it: the neighbour a reader answers with is another
//          test of the same file, never another file.
//   WAIT   even a correctly scoped reader can run before the row lands, because nothing awaits the
//          write.
//
// This file guards the first obligation only, and says so rather than implying a clean bill of
// health. The second cannot be read off the source: "is there a wait" is a question about control
// flow, and a poll loop is only correct when the assertion is that a line EXISTS — polling for an
// absence just spends the timeout before answering. Those live as comments at the call sites.
//
// The ledger is per file with a count, following tests/lib/storable-write-sweep.test.ts: a NEW
// reader in an already-listed file trips this too, not only a new file. The classification is the
// point of the ledger. `tenant-wide` is a real answer for a reader whose subject is the TABLE rather
// than one turn's trail, and it is written down so it stays a decision instead of an omission.
//
// NOTE: the price of a ledger over the whole test tree is that ANY branch adding a reader anywhere
// has to touch this file, and it will find out from this test rather than from review. That is the
// intended cost — it is the same trade tests/lib/storable-write-sweep.test.ts makes over `src/` —
// but it has one edge the other does not: an entry in a file the derivation drops from an edition
// would make this red in that edition and green here. Every file listed below survives into both
// today, and a reader added inside a `@full-only` test file is the case to watch for.
