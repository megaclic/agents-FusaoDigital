// Whether a ledger row stuck non-terminal means a customer went unanswered, as a table.
//
// The table is short, and it got that way by deletion. It used to carry an "already answered"
// verdict decided by comparing the conversation's watermarks, and three review rounds of PR #282
// each found a different way that comparison closes a real loss — a watermark is a per-CONVERSATION
// high-water mark and the question is per-MESSAGE. That fact now comes from the ledger itself: a
// turn that runs over a message retires its row, so a row this function ever sees is one nothing
// covered. The effect is proved in delivery-sweep.test.ts, where a real turn retires a real row.
//
// What is left here is the age fence and the ORDER of the two questions, which is a decision. The
// boundaries are cheap here and expensive through a database.
//
// `ageMs` is the age of the current ATTEMPT, not of the receipt. The sweep resolves which clock that
// is before calling (a claimed row is measured from its claim), and that distinction has its own
// case in the sweep's test, where a real row can carry both timestamps.
