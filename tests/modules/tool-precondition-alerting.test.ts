// PR #378 states, in its body and in the seam's own header, that a precondition refusing a call does
// NOT page an alert channel — the rule doing its job is the system working, not an incident. That
// sentence had no number behind it, and reading the CHANNEL's minLevel gate alone
// (`LEVEL_RANK[ch.minLevel] > rank`) suggests the opposite: `info` ranks 0, so a channel at minLevel
// `info` would pass it. The gate that actually decides is one level up, at the EMITTER
// (`level === "warn" || level === "error"`), so an info event never reaches the dispatcher at all.
//
// Measured here against a real database, with a channel deliberately configured BELOW what the
// console can produce (it offers warn|error, default error) — the strongest case, and one the MCP
// schema (`z.enum(FLOW_LEVELS)`) can actually create.
