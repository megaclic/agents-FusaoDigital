// THE SCOPE HAS TO SURVIVE THE TRANSPORT (#520, review round 1).
//
// `audit_list` is registered through `registerTenantTool`, whose whole job is to make a fleet-level
// SUPER_ADMIN token name a target tenant before any per-tenant tool runs. That is right for every
// other tool on that list and wrong for this one on two of its three scopes: `fleet` and `all` name
// their own trail, so a tenant target is not merely unnecessary there, it is a value the read has
// nowhere to put. Two independent gates enforced it anyway -- the selector in the tool's own schema
// and `readGate`'s null-tenant check -- so the widest reader of the trail could reach the fleet rows
// only by naming an unrelated tenant, and on a deployment with no tenants at all could not reach
// them from MCP whatsoever. The REST surface has answered this correctly since the first commit of
// this PR; the point of these tests is that the two doors agree.
//
// TWO BLOCKS, because the two gates sit on opposite sides of the DB line. `tests/setup.ts` points
// `DATABASE_URL` at a database that does not exist, on purpose, so nothing reaches Postgres through
// `basePrisma`: a call through the registered tool can therefore prove the WRAPPER let it past, and
// never what the read returned. The rows are asserted one layer down, on `auditList` with an
// injected client, which is the same function the wrapper calls.
