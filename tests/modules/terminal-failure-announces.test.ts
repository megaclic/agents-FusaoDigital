// Four buses reach a terminal failure state and, before this, three of them said nothing anywhere:
// the scheduler (for every kind without a hand-written hook), the alert bus, the inbound receptor,
// and the RAG indexer. The operator cannot infer any of them — by definition nothing happens
// afterwards — so the effect asserted here is always the durable row an operator reads
// (`ExecutionLog`), never a return value or a counter, because counting is exactly what did not
// reach anybody.
//
// Integration, real DB, real RLS. Only the network is injected.
