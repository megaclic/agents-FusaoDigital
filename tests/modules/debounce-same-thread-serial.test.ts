// overlap, which is the feature. Overlapping on the SAME thread is the defect.

// message joins, and "anything else (no row, DONE, DEAD, or A CLAIM IN FLIGHT) means the previous
// flush is finished business and this message opens a NEW burst". So a customer who writes while the
// agent is still answering arms a second flush by design, and it fires a debounce window later —
// while the first turn is still in the model, in a tool, or paying out its split balloons.
