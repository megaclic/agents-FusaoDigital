// The field names declared on the `FollowUpStep` interface, read off the source the runtime
// consumes rather than copied into a list.
//
// A step is a bag of OPTIONAL fields, so no runtime read enumerates it: `readFollowUpConfig({})`
// answers a default step carrying three keys, and the optional ones only appear when a bag already
// had them. Every drift check over a step therefore has to name the fields somewhere, and a
// hand-written list is exactly the thing that goes stale — the field added next is missing from the
// list AND from the surface, so the two agree and the test passes.
//
// Two surfaces consult this: the console's form pair (a field it does not carry is DELETED on the
// operator's next save) and the MCP/REST patch schema (a field it does not declare is a field no
// caller is told about, issue #174). The positive control lives HERE rather than in each caller,
// because a parse that finds nothing hands back a list every assertion passes over.
