// The scanner every source sweep counts through, and the phantom site it exists to stop.
//
// A sweep that counts a code shape in `src/` reads the file as text, so prose that NAMES the shape is
// counted as if it were the shape. Measured on #424: a comment citing `REFUSAL_SECTIONS.slice(0, 1)`
// to explain a mutation put a file with no cut in it into the astral-cap ledger. The easy way out is
// worse than the failure it fixes — adding the entry ARMS A WAIVER over a file that has nothing to
// waive, and the day that file grows a real cut the count already matches and the sweep says nothing.
//
// It had already happened once. `tests/graph/refused-turn-callsites.test.ts` carries the same strip
// written inline, and its comment records the two phantom sites that bought it. Two sites, one
// invariant, and nothing obliging the third — so the strip lives here, and `countInSrc` exists so the
// raw-text spelling is not the convenient one.
//
// JSX TEXT IS NOT HANDLED, AND THAT IS A MEASURED DECISION RATHER THAN AN OMISSION.
//
// An earlier version of this file recognised JSX elements so their text would not be counted as code.
// It was correct about the fixture and bought nothing real: with the whole JSX mode removed, all three
// ledgers in this repo count byte-identically and the whole-tree probe below still reports zero files
// ending inside a literal. What it cost was five rounds of review — recognising an element needs a
// dry run, a memo, tag-depth balancing, closing-name matching, multi-line attribute strings — every
// one of them a mechanism justified by a hypothesis rather than by a number.
//
// So the scan removes what is unambiguous (comments, string and template bodies, regex bodies) and
// leaves `<` alone. The failure that leaves is the cheap one and it is bounded: JSX text spelling a
// swept shape would count as code, which is a phantom entry — visible, red, and fixable — rather than
// a swallowed site. Nothing in `src/` does it today; the ledgers are the check.
//
// THAT LAST SENTENCE WAS TOO STRONG ONCE, AND REVIEW CAUGHT IT. JSX text is the one position where a
// URL can be written bare, and its `//` was read as a comment — a SWALLOW, not a phantom, taking a
// real interpolation with it. `http` and `https` are answered now (see `URL_SCHEME`); a bare
// `ws://x` in JSX prose is still a swallow, counted at zero and written down rather than claimed
// away. The bound holds for everything else JSX text can spell.
//
// OFFSETS AND LINE NUMBERS SURVIVE. Every removed character becomes a space and every newline is
// kept, so `source.slice(0, m.index)` still names the same position and `.split("\n").length` still
// names the same line. A sweep can strip and keep reporting where it found things.

type Scanned = {
  text: string;
  // What was still open when the file ended. A misread `/` or `<` announces itself here.
  // NOTE: there is no "jsx" here. An element is recognised by closing, so one that never closes is

  // that model replaced the one that decided on the opening tag.

// ONE FACT DECIDES BOTH AMBIGUITIES, which is why it is a variable and not two heuristics.
//
// `/` is a regex when a value cannot precede it and a division when one can; `<` opens a JSX element
// under exactly the same condition and is a comparison otherwise. Both are answered by "can the token
// just consumed END a value", tracked as the scan goes.
//
// Reading either one wrong in the permissive direction is the expensive half. An unrecognised `/"/g`
// opens a string that swallows the code after it; a `"a" / 2` read as a regex opener swallows to the
// end of the line, taking the `// comment` on it back out of view and counting it as code — the very
// failure this module exists to stop, inverted. Both were found by review on the PR that added this.
//
// The token, not the character: `"a" / 2`, `` `x` / 2 ``, `i++ / 2` and `f() / 2` all end in a value
// whose last character is not a word character.
// Every keyword after which an EXPRESSION begins, so a `/` there opens a regex and a `<` opens a JSX
// element. Missing one is not a stylistic gap: `export default <p>x</p>` was read as a comparison and
// the JSX text counted as code, which is the phantom this module exists to prevent (found by review).

// `endsValue` like every expression-introducing keyword, and it leaves no terminator for
// `atStatementStart` to read, so `if (x) {} else {}` recorded the else body as an OBJECT — and an
// object's `}` ends a value, turning the regex on the next line into a division that never blanks its
// body (found by review).
//
// THE LIST IS ONE WORD BECAUSE THE OTHER CANDIDATES ARE UNMEASURABLE, NOT BECAUSE THEY WERE
// FORGOTTEN. A first draft read `else|try|finally|do`; a mutation run then removed `try|finally|do`
// without turning a single test red. `try` and `finally` are absent from `KEYWORD_BEFORE_VALUE`, so
// they leave `endsValue` true and the `&&` below short-circuits before ever asking this — dead
// alternatives, indistinguishable from a typo. `do` does clear `endsValue`, but its body's `}` is
// always followed by `while (…)`, so the misclassification has nowhere to surface. Adding either back
// would be a rule no test could hold.
//
// NOTE: A MUTATION RUN CANNOT REMOVE THE `\b`, AND THE NOTE IS HERE INSTEAD OF A ROW. Reaching this
// check at all requires `endsValue` to be false, and any identifier ending in those four letters —
// `orelse` — sets it true and short-circuits. So the only token that can both reach here and match is
// the keyword, and `\b` is saying what the regex means rather than deciding anything. It stays for

// TWO NARROWER SPELLINGS WERE TRIED AND BOTH WERE REMOVED BY A MUTATION RUN WITHOUT TURNING A TEST
// RED. `\b(?:https?|wss?|ftps?|file)` claimed five more schemes and a token boundary; nothing reaches
// either, because the only position where this branch can fire is bare JSX text and there is no
// `ws://` written as visible prose in `src/`. What survives is what a person actually types where a
// reader will see it.
//
// A bare `ws://x` in JSX text would still be read as a comment and swallow its line. THAT RESIDUE IS
// COUNTED, NOT ASSUMED: `src/` holds five non-http `scheme://` today, every one inside a `//`
// comment, where the leading slashes are consumed first and these are never examined; none is in a
// `.tsx` file at all. No probe guards it, and that is deliberate — every version of one reads a
// corpse. The swallow happens in the COMMENT branch, so by the time a sweep sees the text the `//`
// is already blanked, and a raw-text probe cannot tell JSX prose from a websocket URL in a string.

// It lived in tests/client/error-toast-reason.test.ts until another test file imported it from
// there, which is what a helper in a `.test.ts` invites. That import cost something measurable:
// under `bun test --shard=k/4` the two files land in different processes, so the exporting file's
// 47 tests registered TWICE across the fleet and the shard totals stopped matching the serial run.
// Nothing failed, and the arithmetic of a gate that no longer adds up is exactly what a gate is for.
//
// ONE SUCH IMPORT IS LEFT, DELIBERATELY. tests/lib/source-text.test.ts takes `bigIntArgs` from
// tests/lib/caller-id-spelling.test.ts, and moving that one was tried and reverted: it drags
// `blankNonCode`, `startsRegex` and `KEYWORDS_BEFORE_REGEX` behind it, and relocating those call
// sites moves `BigInt(` occurrences into a different file, which is the key the waiver ledger in
// caller-id-spelling is written against. Two tests went red for that reason alone. The cost of
// leaving it is 12 test registrations repeated across four shards; the cost of moving it is
// rewriting a ledger to buy them back.
//
// It is NOT merged into `codeOnly` above. That one answers regex bodies and URL schemes and carries
// five rounds of measurement behind those answers; this one does not, and its callers count braces
// rather than positions. Merging them is a change to what those sweeps decide, so it is a separate
// piece of work from moving a function out of a test file.
// The source with every comment and every string body blanked to spaces, offsets preserved.
//
// Counting braces on the raw text drifts, and it drifts SILENTLY: this tree's comments are prose
// about the code and full of `{ error }`, `{{placeholder}}` and `${…}`. One unbalanced brace inside
// one comment shifts every block boundary after it, and the scan then answers about the wrong
// function for the rest of the file. Measured: on the raw text the scan found 28 offenders and
// missed `BusinessHoursForm.tsx:230`, which is a bare `catch {}` under `throw err` read by hand.
