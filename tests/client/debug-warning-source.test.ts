// TWO facts about the console's "recording more than the default" warning that no type can hold,
// and both were review findings rather than guesses.
//
// 1. It must read what the SERVER is doing, not what the form is about to ask it to do. Driven by
//    the form, flipping the tool-values switch off makes the warning disappear on the touch — while
//    the server is still storing the customer's PII, and an operator who leaves without saving takes
//    that answer with them. The opposite is a false positive on a switch just turned on.
// 2. It must go through the shared derivation rather than spell the same `||` out again. A switch
//    added to `readDebugModes` would light the indicator everywhere except in a copy, and a copy in
//    a `.tsx` is invisible to every test that covers that module.
//
// Both are properties of the SOURCE, so the source is what is read. The alternative — rendering the
// component — would cover (1) and could not see (2) at all.
