// not, and the operator who picks one of those has no way to learn it except from attachments that
// silently come back unextracted. The warning belongs where the choice is made.

// NOTE: every assertion reduces to a number or a boolean BEFORE expect. A failing expectation
// holding a DOM node serializes a cyclic happy-dom tree and stalls the runner.
