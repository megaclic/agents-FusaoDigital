// OPENING A TAB MUST NOT REWRITE A TARGET THE RUNTIME STILL HONORS.
//
// A Chatwoot team (or agent) id belongs to ONE account, so both handoff targets are stored with the
// account they were picked in: `contactAuth.handoffTeamInstanceId` and `handoff.targetInstanceId`.
// The runtime reads exactly that — `teamTargetUsable` in modules/chatwoot/webhook.ts and the pinned
// fallback in graph/prepare.ts both say the recorded account decides, per conversation, and that
// counting accounts is only the fallback for a value stored before the field existed.
//
// Both editors were still deciding on the count alone. Bind one inbox per account to the same agent
// (a test inbox beside the live one) and merely OPENING the tab wiped the stored target and left the
// tab marked unsaved, with nobody having touched the form. The next save persisted the loss: refused
// contacts stopped being routed to the team that had been configured for them.
//
// So these tests assert on the SETTER, not on pixels: the write is both the damage and the reason
// the unsaved dot lights up, and a test that only looked at the rendered field would pass on the
// broken code the moment the field still showed the old value for a frame.
//
// NOTE: every assertion reduces to a number or a boolean BEFORE expect. A failing expectation
// holding a DOM node serializes a cyclic happy-dom tree and stalls the runner.
