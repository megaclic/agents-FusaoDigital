// instead of interpolating it: the fallback `t` react-i18next hands out with no provider returns
// the default string, which is exactly what these assertions want.
//
// The cost was not local. `bun test` shares one worker across files, so initialising i18n here
// charged every file that ran afterwards: `KnowledgeApprovals` went from 3.9s to 6.2s and blew the
// 5s per-test budget, in a test that touches none of this. Measured by moving this one file out and
// re-running the folder. Anything imported at a test file's top level is a global side effect.

// The `?` that opens a field's long-form help (issue #411).
//
// It is asserted through a CLICK reaching rendered text, and not by looking for the button or for a
// prop, because the two ways this affordance dies are both invisible to a shallower check.
//
// The first is measured, not imagined: the trigger shipped with an `onClick` that called
// `preventDefault`, added to stop the wrapping <label> from forwarding the click to the control,
// and Radix composes the trigger's handler with `checkForDefaultPrevented`, so cancelling the event
// cancelled its own `onOpenToggle`. The button rendered, the aria wiring was right, and nothing
// opened. (The guard was also unnecessary: a label's activation behaviour does nothing for an event
// targeted at an interactive descendant, and a <button> is one.)
//
// The second is the reason this is a Popover and not a Tooltip at all: a Radix tooltip cannot be
// opened by touch (three handlers close every route in, measured in the note on Popover.tsx) and
// the console has a mobile drawer. A test that only hovered would pass on a component no phone can
// open.
