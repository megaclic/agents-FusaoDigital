// THE GUARD AGAINST THE NEXT FORM THAT SENDS A FIELD REFUSAL TO A BANNER.
//
// #231 put the refused field on the wire, #232 built the state that renders it at the control, and
// this sweep wired the console. What comes back without a guard is the form written next week: it
// will read the server's sentence (the other fence in this directory sees to that) and drop it into
// a toast or an error line, which is far from the input and, on a long form, leaves the operator
// counting down the fields to work out which one the server meant.
//
// Two rules, because a form can fail this in two directions and only one of them is visible:
//
//   1. a form that WRITES holds its refusal — `useFieldRefusal`, or a named reason not to;
//   2. every name a form DECLARES is read back by an `at(…)` call in the same file. A declared name
//      with no control behind it is worse than not declaring it: `placeRefusal` marks it as placed
//      and the caller then keeps the toast silent, so the refusal reaches nobody at all. Measured
//      while wiring ToolEditModal, which declared `allowedHosts` and renders no such input.
