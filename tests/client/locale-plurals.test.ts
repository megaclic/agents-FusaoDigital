// refill itself. `i18next-parser` writes the SAME `defaultValue` into every plural category it
// generates, in every locale — so pluralizing a key produces a wrong singular, and a pt-BR catalog
// full of English, until somebody edits the file by hand. Measured while fixing #509: extracting
// after the call sites moved to `count` replaced fourteen pt-BR translations with their English
// defaults in one run. Nothing fails when that is left as it lands; it just renders.
