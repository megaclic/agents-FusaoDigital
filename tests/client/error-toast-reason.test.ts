// THE GUARD AGAINST THE NEXT HANDLER THAT ASKS THE SERVER AND THEN INVENTS ITS OWN SENTENCE.
//
// The API answers a refusal with a sentence already localized for the request's Accept-Language, and
// since #231 with the field it is about. A handler that catches that and shows "could not save"
// throws away the only part the operator can act on — and a fixed sentence that sounds SPECIFIC is
// worse than one that does not: `hours.saveError` said "Could not save (check the timezone)" for
// every refusal the business-hours write can answer, duplicate name included.
//
// Measured before this sweep: 112 error toasts, 10 of them reading the server's sentence.
//
// What counts as an offender is a rule and not a list, because the two legitimate reasons to show a
// fixed sentence are both derivable from the source:
//
//   - the toast fires BEFORE the handler has talked to the server, so it is a client-side check
//     (an empty name, an unparseable file) and there is no server sentence in existence yet;
//   - the toast is in a bare `catch {}` that no `throw` of the request's error can reach. Measured:
//     Eden does NOT reject on a transport failure, it resolves with `{ status: 503, value: { message,
//     line, column, sourceURL } }` — a `value` with no `error` key. So such a catch sees only a fault
//     in our own handler, and there is nothing of the server's to show.
//
// Everything else is an offender, including the shape that reads as if it were the second case and is
// not: `catch {}` sitting under `if (err || !data) throw err`, which receives the Eden error object
// and discards it at the binding.
