// The trail-wide newest row is IN THE RESPONSE and must not be ON THE PAGE.
//
// `latestAt` stays on the wire for the REST and MCP transports, so the type still offers it and
// nothing in the compiler objects to printing it. What was removed is the affordance: a "Trail
// recorded up to" line above the filters, which duplicated the first card when unfiltered and, when
// filtered, invited a comparison against a record's own `updatedAt` — a comparison that finds a bug
// rather than a state, because the audit row is written inside the mutation's transaction and there
// is no ingestion lag for a freshness line to report. #526.
//
// Asserted as ABSENCE OF THE VALUE rather than absence of a label, so it survives a rewording: the
// stub answers with an instant that appears nowhere else on the page.
