// A LINK SAVED BEFORE THE RENAME STILL OPENS THE ROWS IT NAMED (issue #555).
//
// The two consent actions were renamed and every row moved, and the old spellings left the catalog
// the picker is built from. That leaves a saved `/audit?action=mcp_oauth_consent_granted` — a
// bookmark, a link pasted in a ticket, a dashboard's deep link — naming something no row carries
// any more, and the answer would be an empty trail: the page saying "no consent decision was ever
// recorded" about rows sitting one name over.
//
// What is asserted here is BOTH halves, because either alone is still broken for the operator:
// the request goes out under the name the rows carry, AND the control on screen shows that name
// rather than the dead one. A page that quietly asks the right question while displaying the old
// spelling teaches the operator a name that no longer works.
