// A layout rule that only exists at paint time. happy-dom computes no layout, so what is checked is
// the CLASS the modal hands the preview column — which is where the bug was, and is the thing that
// can silently regress.
//
// What broke: the preview column carries `self-start` (without it `sticky` has nothing to travel
// within), and `self-start` removes the stretch that was giving the column its height. With only a
// `max-h-` ceiling left, the box sat at `min-h-96` and the PDF rendered into 384px of a modal twice
// that tall. The fix is a DEFINITE height, and this is the check that it does not quietly go back to
// a ceiling the next time someone tunes the number.

// the check passed with the iframe stripped bare. The class attribute is on the element either way.
