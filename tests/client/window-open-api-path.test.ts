// A sweep, not an example, because the defect it guards is one nobody sees while writing the line.
//
// `window.open("/api/…")` is a plain browser navigation: it carries cookies and nothing else. Every
// tenant-scoped route resolves the tenant from the `X-Tenant-Id` header the Eden client and
// `mediaFetch` add, and a SUPER_ADMIN has no tenant anywhere else — so for them the new tab lands on
// "a target tenant is required" instead of the file. It looks right in every developer's own browser,
// because a TENANT_ADMIN's tenant comes off the session.
//
// The fix is always the same: fetch through `mediaFetch` and open the blob URL. The rule is stated
// here as a sweep so the next byte endpoint gets it for free — a per-page test would only ever cover
// the page that already had the bug.
