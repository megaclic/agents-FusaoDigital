// WHAT THE READER SEES, which is the thing issue #513 was about. The sweep in `locale-plurals`
// asserts the catalogs HOLD distinct forms; this asserts i18next actually PICKS the singular for a
// count of one, through the real catalogs and the real plural resolver.
//
// The two are not the same assertion, and the gap between them is where this defect lived: a key
// can carry `_one` and `_other` and still render the plural for every count, if the `count` handed
// in is not a number. `AgentEditorPage` passes `Number(p.count ?? 0)` for exactly that reason, and a
// producer that renames the field back to `n` puts a 0 there, which reads as the plural in a
// sentence about one document.
