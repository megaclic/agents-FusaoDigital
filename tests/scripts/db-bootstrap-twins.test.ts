// `scripts/db-bootstrap.ts` and `scripts/db-bootstrap.sql` provision the same thing by two routes:
// the first runs unattended on every container boot, the second is the by-hand psql equivalent for a
// bare Postgres (both say so in their headers). They are the same question asked in two places, and
// that is the shape that goes stale — measured: the membership RECONCILE was added to the TypeScript
// and not to the SQL, so the documented manual path went on leaving a recreated database readable by
// the previous installation's runtime role. Nothing was red, because the `.sql` has no test at all.
//
// This is the cheapest fence that would have caught it. It cannot execute the psql script (the
// `\set` / `:'var'` syntax is a psql feature, not SQL), so it asks whether each file CONTAINS the
// construct for each invariant. A rename breaks it loudly, which is the failure mode to want here.
