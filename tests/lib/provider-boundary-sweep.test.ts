// THE GUARD AGAINST THE TENTH CALL SITE.
//
// The rule this file enforces was already written down nine times when the leak that motivated it
// was found, once beside each call site that follows it: `ChatwootApiError` (status and endpoint,
// never the body), `SttError` / `VisionError` (`never capture the response body`), the tool lane's
// first-line cut, the `tts` line's slug-shaped code, `redactSecretsDeep` on `detail`, the guard on
// the contact-authorization `reason`, and so on. Every one of those carries a comment explaining
// why. It still did not stop the tenth boundary from being written without it, because a rule kept
// beside its call sites is invisible from the place where the next call site is born.
//
// Prose cannot fix that — `docs/stt.md` already says "Adding a provider = one function + one
// registry entry" and names `SttError`, which is exactly why `stt` and `vision` held while
// embeddings, in a module with no such paragraph, did not. What reaches a module that does not
// exist yet is a check that FAILS on it.
//
// So: a file that authenticates to an operator-configured endpoint and issues a request is a
// provider boundary, and every one of them must be listed below saying HOW it keeps the other end's
// text out of an operator-facing store. A new one is a test failure until somebody answers the
// question. The list is the deliverable; the assertions under it are what keep the answers honest.

// How each boundary discharges the rule.
//
//   own-error-type   throws only a class it defines, built from a status and a constant
//   throughProvider  wraps the call in `@/lib/provider-failure`
//   runModelCall     the request is issued elsewhere, behind the model semaphore, which reduces it
//   not-a-provider   matched the predicate without being one; the entry records the judgement
