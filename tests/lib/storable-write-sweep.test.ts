// THE GUARD AGAINST THE NEXT COLUMN THAT LOSES AN ERROR MESSAGE.
//
// Third instance of one shape, and the reason it is a sweep rather than a fourth call-site fix. The
// inbound receptor lost a delivery to a character in a third party's body (#218), both `jsonb`
// walkers behind the flow log and the audit log lost a row to the same thing (#241), and this file
// is the answer to the same question asked of every column that holds an ERROR message:
//
//   does this value reach a column, and has anything applied the rule the column enforces?
//
// The rule, measured against this project's own Postgres. A NUL is refused outright by `text` and by
// `jsonb` alike (22021 / 22P05). An unpaired surrogate is WORSE than refused in a `text` parameter:
// the driver spends one byte of the tail encoding its replacement, so `boom\ud800tail` lands as
// `boom<U+FFFD>tai` (one character eaten, silently) and only refuses at all when the orphan sits at
// the very end and the truncated `EF BF` becomes the last bytes.
//
// Error text is where this bites, and the demonstrated way a third party's bytes get in is an HTTP
// tool: it passes the remote endpoint's response body through verbatim so the model can read it,
// `toolFailure` makes that body the failure's cause, and with `observability.logToolValues` on the
// whole body reaches `execution_logs.error_message` (tests/graph/tool-flowlog.test.ts). Asking for
// detailed logging is what used to make the line disappear.
//
// The write it breaks is also the bookkeeping ABOUT a failure: `failJob` is the transition that
// either schedules the retry or dead-letters the job, so a refused write leaves the row CLAIMED
// with its old `attempts`, and nothing reclaims it, nothing reports it (issue #243).
//
// So `sanitizeErrorMessage` (src/lib/redact.ts) is the ONE place the rule is applied to error text,
// and this file is the check, in two halves:
//
//   1. its output survives every column that holds an error message, asserted at the ROW;
//   2. the source ledgers below account for every line that puts text in one of those columns, so a
//      new writer that reaches for a bare cut is a failure here rather than a job that stops moving.
//
// The second half exists because a table like the first proves the FUNCTION and nothing about
// whether the call sites call it (#205). What the ledgers pin is exactly that.
//
// NOT in scope, and stated so the ledgers are not read as a clean bill of health for the tree: this
// is the error family only. The wider question, every write of externally-sourced text into a
// column, reaches other places with other right answers (a model's own output, the text extracted
// from an uploaded file, the Chatwoot mirror, an OAuth client's own registration). Each needs its
// own reading of who can act on a refusal, which is exactly why they are not folded in here under
// one blanket policy.

const NUL = String.fromCharCode(0);

// Each is a message a provider, an HTTP tool or a third party can produce, and each is refused or
// corrupted by a `text` column as it stands. The last one is the ordering trap: dropping the NUL
// first would join the two orphan halves into U+10000, a character nobody wrote.
