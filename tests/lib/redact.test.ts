// REPAIRING A VALUE CAN RECONSTRUCT WHAT THE REDACTOR JUST FAILED TO MATCH.
//
// The walker does two things to every string: it scrubs secret-shaped substrings, and it repairs the
// characters a `jsonb` column refuses. The order between them is load-bearing and was wrong: a NUL
// inside a token breaks the pattern, so the redactor sees nothing to scrub, and the repair then
// DELETES that NUL and stores the token whole. Measured before the fix:
//
//   { note: "token sk-<NUL>abcdefghijklmnop" }  ->  { note: "token sk-abcdefghijklmnop" }
//   { "pass<NUL>word": "hunter2" }              ->  { password: "hunter2" }
//
// Both are the same mistake in the two places the walker makes a decision about a string, and both
// defeat the invariant the whole module exists for. The repair is what makes the value storable, so
// it cannot simply be dropped: it has to happen BEFORE the decision that reads the string.
//
// A NUL is the character that matters here, because it is the one the repair DELETES. An orphan half
// becomes U+FFFD, which leaves `pass<U+FFFD>word` visibly broken rather than passing as `password`.
