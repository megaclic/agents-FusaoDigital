// Stubbing a THIRD-PARTY module is a process-wide act, and this ledger is where each one is argued
// for.
//
// `mock.module` has no file scope and no teardown: whatever it installs is what every file that runs
// afterwards imports, for the rest of the process. For a `@/` target that is survivable — the module
// is ours and the blast radius is a directory we own. For a package it is not: nobody downstream
// knows it was replaced, the stub is written for one caller's needs, and a `mockReset()` on one of
// its functions leaves that function RETURNING UNDEFINED rather than throwing. Code that reads a
// property off the result dies with a TypeError, which its own catch reports as ordinary bad input.
//
// Measured on 2026-08-27 (issue #420): a stub of `jose` left `jwtVerify` returning `undefined` for
// the files that ran after it. Every session cookie became a 401, the failure named the cookie, and
// it took ten CI runs to find, because each layer between the stub and the assertion translated the
// fault into its own vocabulary.
//
// ## Why the rule is "argue for it" and not "restore it afterwards"
//
// Restoring is the intuitive rule and it is the wrong one, on two counts both measured while this
// file was being reviewed. It is not SUFFICIENT: `await import()` hands back a LIVE namespace that
// the mock rewrites in place, so a teardown handing that namespace back re-registers the stub while
// reading as a cleanup — and a teardown is free to install a different stub entirely, which no
// reader of the source can tell from a real restore. And it is not what fixed the outage: what
// fixed it was the stub DELEGATING to the real implementation, so that the leak, which is permanent
// either way, carries correct behaviour.
//
// So the sweep asks the only question a reader can answer honestly — is this package stubbed at
// all? — and every yes owes a line here saying what keeps it harmless.

// A package is a specifier that is not a path: `jose`, `@scope/name`. Anything starting with `.`,
// `/` or `@/` is ours (or relative) and out of scope — the leading-dot case is not hypothetical,
// it slipped through an earlier spelling of this pattern and the table below is what caught it.
