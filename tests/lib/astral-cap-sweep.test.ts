// THE GUARD AGAINST THE NEXT CAP THAT CUTS A CHARACTER IN HALF.
//
// `clipText` was written for ONE field (#122) and its comment already spelled out the whole cost:
// a `slice` that lands between the two halves of an astral character leaves an unpaired surrogate,
// Postgres refuses one inside a `jsonb` write, and anywhere it survives it renders as a replacement
// character in the middle of somebody's name. Every OTHER cap in the tree kept using a bare `slice`
// anyway — the rule was written next to its one call site, which is the one place a person writing
// the next cap never looks.
//
// So the rule lives with the function now (`src/lib/text.ts`) and this file is the check: every cap
// that bounds text is listed below with the entry point that reaches it, and each is fed a value
// whose astral character straddles the cut. A new cap that forgets is a failure here.
//
// NOT in scope, and the distinction is the whole reason a regex sweep would be useless: an
// index-based slice at a position the code computed (a delimiter, a trailing separator, an array
// bound) is a different operation. `slug.slice(0, 28)` after the string was already reduced to
// `[a-z0-9_-]` cannot split anything.

// `for...of` yields a well-formed pair as ONE two-unit string, so a single-unit string in the
// surrogate range is by definition an orphan half.

// The behavioural table above proves the caps it can reach. It cannot prove the ABSENCE of a cap it
// forgot, and forgetting is the documented failure mode here: #216 named four, the first sweep found
// seventeen, and review found an eighteenth in `truncForAudit` — a walker with the same shape as
// `redactSecretsDeep`, writing to the same kind of column, missed because its file was counted and
// not read.

// A regex cannot tell a string cut from an array bound, so it cannot decide this on its own. What it
// can do is refuse to let anyone decide it silently: every remaining occurrence is counted here with
// a judgement attached, and a routed cap leaves no occurrence at all. A new bare cut — text or not —
// fails this test until somebody writes down which it is.
//
// TWO shapes are counted, and the second was added after review found a cap the first could not see:
// `.slice(0, n)` keeps the head, `.slice(-n)` / `.slice(x.length - n)` keeps the tail. Both bound a
// value to a maximum length; every other `.slice(…)` in the tree names a position the code computed
// (a delimiter, a marker's length, a caret, a tokenizer's window) and cannot be a cap at all.
