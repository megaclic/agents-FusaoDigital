// advertises (`RateLimit-Limit: 20` is the credential bucket, 1000000 the global
// one), the other measures what a rejected request costs by watching the
// remaining budget move. All four of these are environment variables, so a
// developer who tunes one in their `.env` would watch a correct app fail, and
// fail with `Expected: "20", Received: "1000000"`, which is exactly the signature
// of the limiter-collision regression those tests exist to catch. Pinning here,
// at preload and before any module reads config, is what keeps that signal
// unambiguous.
//
// THE GLOBAL BUDGET IS PINNED HIGH RATHER THAN SHIPPED-ACCURATE, and that is the
// one number here that is not the production default. `server.handle` has no
// socket, so `server.requestIP` answers nothing and `resolveClientIp` falls back
// to the constant "unknown": every request every file sends through the app
// shares ONE bucket, for the whole process, over a 60s window. Measured in a
// fresh process, the 601st `server.handle` call came back 429. The limiter is not
// wrong — in production each client carries its own peer — but the ambient
// ceiling is a resource 520 files compete for, and whoever is running when it
// runs out fails on a status it never asked about. It cost two branding tests on
// master CI (429 where they expected 200 and 401) while the same suite passed
// locally: what differs between the two machines is how the requests fall across
// the minute, not what any of them assert.
//
// The other three stay shipped-accurate, because nothing can exhaust them
// through that shared key: the MCP transport bucket is reached from two call
// sites in the whole suite, and the credential bucket (20 per 5 minutes, and the
// suite runs in under 5) from none — every test that drives /auth/login either
// runs a real server, where the peer is 127.0.0.1 and the key is its own, or
// calls the service directly.
//
// The limiter is still exercised at a reachable budget, which is the coverage
// this line would otherwise cost: rateLimit.test.ts and rateLimitMetering.test.ts
// build the REAL middleware with an explicit `max`, which is what that parameter
// exists for.
