-- `assign_label` became `set_labels` (issue #568): the tool no longer adds one label, it writes the
-- whole set the model asks for, and a name that says "add" would lie about a call that removes.
--
-- Three moves, and the last two are the ones a rename of a native usually does not need. They exist
-- because the OLD name is stored in a tenant's own rows, and every reader of those rows drops what
-- it does not recognise: silently, with a 200, and with the capability simply gone.
--
-- 1. TENANT TOOLS NAMED `set_labels`. Same reason as every other file of this name (see
--    20260903120000): the assembly reserves every native name granted or not
--    (src/graph/tools/unique-names.ts, #457), so a tenant row carrying the new name would stop
--    reaching the model the moment this migration's code ships. Moved to the first free
--    `<name>_N` in its own tenant, with the label following the name where the console would
--    derive the old one from it, and one audit line per moved row plus one per agent whose system
--    prompt names the tool. `tests/prisma/native-tool-names-renamed-by-migration.test.ts` asks for
--    this file by name.
--
--    BOTH TABLES, and the free-name search asks both too. HTTP tools and CODE tools are ONE
--    namespace to the model (code-tools/service.ts checks a new name against both) and both reach
--    `dropDuplicateToolNames`, so a code tool named `set_labels` is dropped by the same
--    reservation, and a candidate `set_labels_2` free among HTTP tools can be taken by a code tool.
--    The files of this name that predate `code_tool_definitions` (20260903140100) had only one
--    table to scan; this one has two.
--
-- 2. The GRANT. `agent_tool_selections` with source NATIVE holds the exact allowlist
--    (src/graph/tools/assemble.ts: an explicit row means EXACTLY this set, fail-closed), so an
--    agent granted `assign_label` and nothing else would come up with no label tool at all — not
--    an error anywhere, just an agent that stopped labelling. Only rows that do not ALREADY carry
--    the new name are touched, so the array cannot end up with it twice.
--
-- 3. The GUIDANCE. `settings.toolGuidance` is keyed by native tool name and `readToolGuidance`
--    drops every key that is not in the catalog, so the operator's "when to use this" note would
--    vanish from the description on the next turn with nothing to show it ever existed. Moved only
--    when the new key is absent, for the same reason as the grant.
--
-- 4. The PRECONDITION. `settings.toolPreconditions` is keyed by tool name too, and it is the one
--    entry here whose loss is not a lost capability but a lost GUARD: `readToolPreconditions` keeps
--    whatever name it finds and `applyToolPreconditions` matches by tool name, so a rule left under
--    the old name simply stops matching and the tool the operator fenced runs unfenced, with the
--    editor still showing the rule. The write side is stricter than the reader and would refuse the
--    next save outright (`isGuardableToolName` checks the KEY against the native catalog), so an
--    unmoved key also bricks settings saves for that agent. Same two-step as the guidance.
--
-- STOP-MIGRATE-START, and it is not optional here (review round 41). The boot order in
-- docs/deploy.md runs `migrate deploy` in the NEW container with the old one still serving, and the
-- old one reads all four places below under the old name only. The costliest of the four is the
-- PRECONDITION: the rule stops matching while `assign_label` is still exposed, so the tool the
-- operator fenced runs unfenced until that process exits. The note in docs/deploy.md carries the
-- window and the repair.
--
-- FORCE ROW LEVEL SECURITY binds the table owner too, so an UPDATE here would reach zero rows and
-- report success. Lifted on the four tables for the file and put back (.claude/rules/prisma.md).
--
-- ONE TRANSACTION, because the lift above is exactly the invariant `.claude/rules/prisma.md` names:
-- `migrate deploy` runs the file OUTSIDE a transaction, so a failure between the lift and the
-- restore leaves four tables no longer binding their own owner to the tenant policy, with the
-- migration marked applied and nothing in the log. `BEGIN`/`COMMIT` inside the `.sql` is honoured.
--
-- `console_tool_name` is copied VERBATIM from 20260903120000, translate table and all, because it
-- has to answer what the console's `normalizeToolName` answers: the console submits
-- `normalizeToolName(label)` as the name on every save, so a moved row whose label still derives
-- the reserved name can never be saved from there again. A simplified version would get every
-- diacritic wrong, which is exactly the case rounds 21 and 22 of PR #485 were about.

-- THE PROMPT THAT NAMES THE TOOL, which for the NATIVE rename is a different case from the HTTP one
-- above. There the new name is a per-tenant `<name>_N` and the prompt could mean either tool, so the
-- migration writes a line and leaves the prose to the operator. Here the mapping is the one this
-- release states — `assign_label` became `set_labels`, and nothing else answers to the old name —
-- so leaving it would mean shipping prompts that instruct the model to call a tool the catalog no
-- longer has. The sample agent this repo ships did exactly that (round 26).
--
-- `\y` is a word boundary and `_` is a word character to it, so `xassign_labelx` is left alone. The
-- audit line goes in under the SAME action the block above uses: what the operator needs from both
-- is one list of the prompts an upgrade touched.
