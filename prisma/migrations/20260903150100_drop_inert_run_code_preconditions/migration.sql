-- A precondition (#101) is keyed by TOOL NAME, and the seam that applies it is deliberately
-- source-agnostic: one map reaches native, HTTP, code, document, MCP and toolpack tools, because
-- they have already been merged into one name-unique list by the time it runs (graph/prepare.ts,
-- and the note above `emptyMap` in modules/agents/tool-preconditions.ts).
--
-- `run_code` stops being a tool name this release owns. The rule keyed to it is therefore about to
-- name nothing, and an inert rule is worse than no rule: the console cannot show it (the editor
-- lists guardable names, and after this release `run_code` is not one), so it sits in the settings
-- bag where nobody can read it or remove it.
--
-- What it must NOT do is delete a rule that still guards something. Only a NATIVE name passes the
-- write boundary (`isGuardableToolName`), but an agent IMPORT copies a settings bag verbatim, and
-- the runtime honours a non-native key when the name matches a tool that exists -- deliberately,
-- and documented where that reader lives. So a bundle can carry a rule keyed `run_code` for an HTTP
-- tool of that name, and the migration one window earlier (20260903120000) moved exactly such tools
-- to `<name>_N`, with the one before this (20260903150000) putting them back. Deleting the key
-- unconditionally would hand those tools back their name without the condition they were imported
-- with: callable, ungated, and no line anywhere saying a guard was dropped (round 32).
--
-- So the question is asked of the state AFTER the restore, which is why this runs after it: does
-- anything in this tenant still answer to `run_code`? If it does, the rule keeps guarding it and
-- stays; if nothing does, the rule names nothing and goes. The direction of the doubt is deliberate:
-- a rule kept alive is a refusal an operator can see happening, and a rule deleted is a guard that
-- silently stops existing.
--
-- "Answers to" is the name the MODEL sees, not the stored spelling, for the reason the restore
-- spells out: names were only canonicalized on write by the PR this ships in, so a database can
-- hold `Run_Code` or `run__code`, and `sanitizeToolName` derives `run_code` from each. The
-- derivation is the one both earlier migrations used, copied rather than referenced because a
-- migration is frozen by design and `pg_temp` does not outlive the session that made it.
--
-- THREE kinds are asked, not two, because "source-agnostic" is the whole premise and a predicate
-- that stops at the tables holding a `name` column reinstates exactly the hole it closes for HTTP
-- tools (round 33). An integration's tool names are not in a `name` column but they ARE in this
-- database: the grant is fail-closed and allowlisted, so `agent_tool_selections.enabled_tools` is
-- the list of names that toolpack can answer to, and a toolpack exposes them BARE (`drive_find_file`
-- and its siblings, measured).
--
-- MCP is the source that looks like it belongs here and does not, which round 33 got wrong and
-- round 35 measured: an MCP tool never reaches the model under its upstream name. It is namespaced
-- to `mcp__<server>__<tool>` (graph/tools/mcp.ts), and the allowlist holds the BARE name because
-- filtering happens before the rename. So a rule keyed `run_code` cannot be guarding an MCP tool,
-- and keeping the key for one preserves exactly the invisible inert rule this file removes. NATIVE
-- and RAG rows are out for a different reason: the native `run_code` grant is what the migration
-- two files earlier removes, and reading it back here would resurrect the guard for the only case
-- this file exists to clean.
--
-- The integration arm cannot fire today (measured: no registered toolpack publishes a tool named
-- `run_code`, and the set is a closed allowlist in code, not operator text), and it costs one
-- predicate to keep a toolpack added later from walking into this.
--
-- Data migration over FORCE RLS tables: lifted for the statement on every table it writes AND
-- reads, restored after (.claude/rules/prisma.md). The write is idempotent: a second run matches no
-- row.
