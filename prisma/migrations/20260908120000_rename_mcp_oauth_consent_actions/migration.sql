-- The two audit actions that predate the `<entity>.<verb>` convention (#392) get the shape every
-- other one has. They are not legacy names on a dead producer: `auditConsentDecision` writes one of
-- them on every MCP OAuth consent decision, and the console's action filter renders the catalog
-- VERBATIM, so the odd spelling reaches the operator as noise and suggests the family it belongs to
-- is somewhere else.
--
--     mcp_oauth_consent_granted  ->  mcp_oauth_consent.grant
--     mcp_oauth_consent_denied   ->  mcp_oauth_consent.deny
--
-- WHY THE RENAME CANNOT BE PRODUCER-ONLY. The rows already recorded stay in `audit_logs` forever,
-- and the filter offers exactly the catalog: rename the producers alone and the same act sits under
-- two names, only one of which can be picked. The old rows are not hidden, they are unreachable
-- through the only door the page has.
--
-- Keyed on the WHOLE name rather than a prefix: `mcp_client.*`, `mcp_connection.*`, `mcp_approval.*`
-- and `mcp_token.*` are neighbours in the same family and already conventional.
--
-- `action` carries no index (`audit_logs` is indexed for the keyset walk: `(tenant_id, created_at
-- DESC, id DESC)` and `(created_at DESC, id DESC)`), so each statement is one sequential scan of the
-- table. That is the right trade here rather than building an index for two one-time UPDATEs: the
-- matching rows are consent decisions, which are written once per operator per client, and the scan
-- takes no lock beyond the ROW EXCLUSIVE an ordinary write already takes.
--
-- RLS: a data migration lifts FORCE on every forced table it writes AND reads, and restores it
-- (.claude/rules/prisma.md, tests/prisma/migration-rls-bypass.test.ts). Without it, on the managed
-- Postgres where `MIGRATION_DATABASE_URL` is the owner without rolsuper, both statements match ZERO
-- rows and report success.
--
-- AND THE FILE OPENS ITS OWN TRANSACTION, because Prisma does not open one for it. Measured in #520
-- and again here, against a scratch database with a migration that fails after its first statement:
-- without a BEGIN that statement PERSISTS through the failure, with one the state is back, and both
-- times the migration is marked as failed. Without the BEGIN, a failure after the lift would leave
-- `audit_logs` with FORCE OFF — the table stops binding its owner to
-- the tenant policy, which is a weaker invariant than the half-renamed rows beside it and the one
-- worth being atomic about (round 3 of review). Safe here because nothing in this file is a
-- statement Postgres refuses inside a transaction (`CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY` is the one that is,
-- and this file has none).
